I've been meaning to take notes on [[the expanding circle]] but I haven't found the time to do it; I think I'd like to [[prioritize]] it.

I'll try to write my notes here free form.

This is a hugely influential book for me but, wait for this, I haven't finished it yet. I sometimes take unreasonably long to finishing things; it is one of my traits. I am often context switching and have many side projects. But because this book describes a proposition that is inherently valuable to me (valuable as a scaffolding; not necessarily with all of the original author's take, as science ever advances), I consider it core to my thinking even if I haven't finished it yet. Let me tell you why perhaps, even before I get to finishing it.
