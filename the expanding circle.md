I've been meaning to take notes on [[the expanding circle]] but I haven't found the time to do it. I didn't take notes here as I was reading it as I did much of the reading at night, in my [[e reader]].

I'll now try to write my impressions here in free form as I can and as I reference it through the [[agora]].

This is a hugely influential book for me but, wait for this, I only finished it on [[2021-12-21]] (I sometimes take unreasonably long to finishing things; it is one of my noticeable traits. In this case I left it at essentially 90% of the way through for no good reason but inefficiencies when scheduling it for reading.) 

But because this book describes a proposition that I already believed, it felt valuable to me already. I considered it core to my thinking even if I hadn't finished it yet. It is a good [[distillation]] of the ideas of [[effective altruism]], or the ideas that led to the movement and represent, IMHO, its reasonable core.
