# Athens Research

- A [[project]] led by [[jeff tang]].
- [[go]] https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/
- Probably the best [[roam like]] soon; but it is currently still in closed beta.
- [[clojure]], [[datascript]] based.
- I/O with Agora will probably be through something like [[roam2agora]] (to begin with).
   - https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/issues/98 for export support.
- See also: [[athens]] ([[Agora plan]]: the Agora should resolve "see also" blocks.)
