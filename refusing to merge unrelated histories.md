- an [[error]].
  - [[git]].

I get this a lot when trying to merge repositories with different histories -- which of course shouldn't happen often, but does happen to me when I'm trying to [[bootstrap]] a new repository.

Case in point: writing the README first when creating the repository in [[gitlab]] or [[github]] makes sense to me, as it's checking a checkbox and editing. And uploading a set of bootstrapping files then makes sense as a second step to me -- but that is ideally done right at the place files live, and once there it's easy to just say `git init`.
