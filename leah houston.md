- "how do you get people to agree"
  - and prevent people with high charisma/influence from driving the community exclusively
- [[leah]]
- how do you get everyone to participate?
  - some people may have issues:
    - executive function issues
    - addictions
    - ...
- alleviate suffering, prevent death and permanent disability
  - the majority of doctors go into medicine to [[help people]]
- lobbying for healthcare reform
- incentives are misaligned
  - physicians are being prevented from helping people
  - if you develop a system that allows them to operate in a more cooperative and aligned environment, we can:
    - reduce cost
    - restore trust to doctor/patient relationship
- ran into bitcoin in [[2012]]
  - became interested in decentralized identity
  - suffered identity theft by a hospital (!)
- founded [[hpec]]
  - wanted it to be a [[non profit]], but it's hard to get investors that way
  - [[b corp]] could be an alternative
  - in the end is [[for profit]] but it'll be a [[dao]]
  - mostly funded by doctors (!)
  - [[inclusive stakeholding]]
  - [[hie of one]] is also in this space: https://hieofone.com/
- founded [[evercred]]
- how do you manage [[governance]]?
  - right now the only decentralized part is identity/certification checking
  - token incentives, moderation protocol
  - will be tested properly when a few thousand people are around
- [[counter anti disintermediation]]
- [[liquid democracy]]
  - [[holacracy]]
  - [[quadratic voting]]
