# ui

- Flancia is a [[game]], and every computer game has a [[ui]].
  - The Agora is 90s looking, partly on purpose, partly due to lack of [[time]] :)
  - I admire the [[hacker ethos]] so I don't mind [[things]] which are nerdy/old school/[[y2k]] looking.
  - But I'd love to improve the UI to make it more [[usable]] and [[accessible]].
  - [[pull]] [[ux]]
    - the [[agora]] should be [[diverse]] and [[inclusive]].
