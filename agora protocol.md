# Agora Protocol
- a [[convention]]
	- the [[agora]] you're likely reading this on is just one possible implementation of a platform built on a simple protocol. The protocol is defined as a list of [[agora rfcs]] as kept by a community agreeing to cooperate on such a list.
	- the agora is a root that wants to grow into a [[tree]], and from there into a [[.
		- an [[agora]] starts with a list of [[gardens]], that is, [[personal knowledge graphs]] as volunteered by its users.
			- the root repository is [[go/agora/git]]
			- the goals of an agora are maintained by its community in the node [[goals]].
		  - [[agora server]] is a reference implementation for a consumer of the protocol.
			- the [[agora server]] repository is [[go/agora/git]]
		- A [[distributed knowledge graph]].
	- Compatible [[agoras]] are expected to assemble into [[agora networks]].
