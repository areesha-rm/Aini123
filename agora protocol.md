- The [[Agora]] you're likely reading this on is just one possible implementation of a platform built on a protocol. It has three parts:
  - A [[convention]].
  - A [[distributed knowledge graph]].
  - [[agora server]] is a reference implementation for a consumer of the protocol.
  - [[agora bridge]] is a reference implementation for a of the protocol.
- Compatible [[agoras]] are expected to assemble into [[agora networks]].
- [[pull]] [[wikilinks everywhere]]
- [[pull]] [[agora convention]]
