- # Agora Protocol
- a [[document]].
	- Trying to define a high level [[protocol]], plus a roadmap for a platform or network making use of it.
	- #go https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JdaC_9J0uYFNFp7g7x4VNtMxJSZQsE2MQkOMmydLCCc/edit
- a [[convention]].
	- To communicate with each other with good intent.
	- [[text based]]. you can use it anywhere you can write down text; no special format requirements.
	- Agora Protocol in a nutshell: https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1437079533253976066
	- You can use [[wikilinks]]. This expresses an intention to make use the [[wiki protocol]], of which the Agora is a special case.
		- The reference Agora, in which you are probably reading this, also has some limited [[hashtag]] support.
		- An Agora is any virtual space you can define in any way you want as long as it is [[explicit]] and by default [[public]].
			- Each Agora publishes a set of definitions of intention as expressed by its [[users]].
			- This Agora is [[rational]], [[pro social]] and [[heterarchical]].
- a [[protocol]].
	- the [[agora exchange format]].
	- [[plain text]] plus [[wikilinks]] as layer 0 (bootstrapping layer).
		- indented bulleted lists designate a [[heterarchy]].
		- successive layers are explicitly discussed through [[agora rfcs]] and settled through a [[governance layer]] called an [[agora]] and defined by convention.
			- agora protocol payloads may be exchanged for knowledge for [[free]] in any designated [[agora]].
			- this [[agora]] is built around a [[pro social]] [[distributed knowledge graph]], that is, a [[social knowledge graph]].
			- see [[go/agora-slides]] for more.
		- to see the communally maintained text of the full protocol, please refer to the [[stoa]] below.

	- a [[protocol]] is a set of explicit conventions that can be followed for a purpose.
		- conventions can be optional or necessary and must be marked as such. The default commitment level for this protocol is [[optional]]. [[use must if you must]].
	- for [[extensions]]
		- please propose them in the stoa below
		- or modify the list of [[agora rfcs]] as kept by the community agreeing to cooperate on such a list: the community of the [[agora]].
	- the [[agora]] is a seed that wants to grow into a [[tree]], and from there into a [[distributed]] network.
		- the [[seed]] of this agora is [[go/agora/git]], an [[interlay]].
			- [[agora server]], [[agora bridge]] and [[flancia collective]] are its keepers.
		- compatible [[agoras]] are expected to assemble into an  [[agora network]] in the future where they can fork and federate as as needed.
		- [[agoras]] must communicate clear [[goals]].
