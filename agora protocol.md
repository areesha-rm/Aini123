# Agora Protocol

- a [[protocol]]
	- [[plain text]] plus [[wikilinks]] as layer 0 (bootstrapping layer).
		- indented bulleted lists designate a [[heterarchy]].
		- successive layers are explicitly discussed through [[agora rfcs]] and settled through a [[governance layer]] called an [[agora]].
			- agora protocol payloads may be exchanged for further knowledge for [[free]] in any designated [[agora]].
			- (this [[agora]] is built around a [[pro social]] [[distributed knowledge graph]], that is, a [[social knowledge graph]].)
			- (see [[go/agora-slides]] for more.)
		- to see the communally maintained text of the full protocol, please refer to the [[stoa]] below.
			- [[stoa]] https://stoa.anagora.org/p/stoa
- a set of [[conventions]]
	- a [[protocol]] is a set of explicit conventions that can be followed for a purpose. 
		- conventions can be optional or necessary and must be marked as such. The default commitment level for this protocol is [[optional]]. [[use must if you must]].
	- the [[agora]] you're likely reading this in is just one possible implementation of a platform or [[framework]] built on a simple protocol. 
		- [[the agora is a markup convention]]
	- for [[extensions]]
		- please propose them in the stoa below
		- or modify the list of [[agora rfcs]] as kept by the community agreeing to cooperate on such a list: the community of the [[agora]].
	- the [[agora]] is a seed that wants to grow into a [[tree]], and from there into a [[distributed]] network.
		- an [[agora]] starts with a list of [[gardens]], that is, [[personal knowledge graphs]] as volunteered by its users.
		- compatible [[agoras]] are expected to assemble into [[agora networks]] in the future.
- you are reading this on a particular [[implementation]] of a tools that tries to build on the agora protocol. 
	- that is, this is [[an agora]] -- but just one of many.
	- its root repository is [[go/agora/git]]
		- [[agora server]] is a reference implementation for a server based integrator/[[interlay]].
			- the [[agora server]] repository is [[go/agora-server/git]]
	- the goals of this agora are engineered by its community by contributing to the following nodes: [[goals]], [[do]], [[contract]], [[flancia collective]] and all [[pulled]].
