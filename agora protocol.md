- a [[document]].
	- Trying to define a high level [[protocol]], plus a roadmap for a platform or network making use of it.

  - I started with [[google docs]] in 2019/2020 and then I tried moving to [[hedgedoc]] but actually I think I might just go back to the [[google doc]]. It's just a rich experience, and several potential collaborators already use it (they left comments).
- a [[convention]].
	- To communicate with each other with good intent.
	- [[text based]]. you can use it anywhere you can write down text; no special format requirements.
	- Agora Protocol in a nutshell: https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1437079533253976066
  - [[layer 0]]
	- [[layer 1]]
    - You can use [[wikilinks]]. This expresses an intention to make use the [[wiki protocol]], of which the Agora is a special case.
		- The reference Agora, in which you are probably reading this, also has some limited [[hashtag]] support.
		- An Agora is any virtual space you can define in any way you want as long as it is [[explicit]] and by default [[public]].
			- Each Agora publishes a set of definitions of intention as expressed by its [[users]].
			- This Agora is [[rational]], [[pro social]] and [[heterarchical]].
- a [[protocol]].
  - for [[federation]].
	- can be bootstrapped with [[agora exchange format]]?
    - #pull [[knowledge commons]]
	- [[plain text]] plus as layer 0 (bootstrapping layer).
		- indented bulleted lists designate a useful [[heterarchy]].
    - [[wikilinks]] and #hashtags at layer 1, plus other link conventions and metadata extensions.
		- successive layers are explicitly discussed through [[agora rfcs]] and settled through a [[governance layer]] called an [[agora]] and defined by convention.
			- agora protocol payloads may be exchanged for knowledge for [[free]] in any designated [[agora]].
			- this [[agora]] is built around a [[pro social]] [[distributed knowledge graph]], that is, a [[social knowledge graph]].
			- see [[go/agora-slides]] for more.
		- to see the communally maintained text of the full protocol, please refer to the [[stoa]] below.
			- [[stoa]] https://stoa.anagora.org/p/stoa
	- a [[protocol]] is a set of explicit conventions that can be followed for a purpose.
		- conventions can be optional or necessary and must be marked as such. The default commitment level for this protocol is [[optional]]. [[use must if you must]].
	- for [[extensions]]:
		- push to or modify [[agora rfcs]].
      - this is as kept by the community agreeing to cooperate on such a list: the community of the [[agora]].
      - #push [[agora]]
        - an [[agora]] is a seed that wants to grow into a [[tree]], and from there into a [[distributed]] network.
        - the [[seed]] of this agora is [[go/agora/git]], defining a [[commons]].
        - [[flancia collective]] is the keeper of https://anagora.org.
        - [[agora bridge]], [[agora server]] contain input (write) and output (read) code respectively.
    - #push [[agoras]]
      - Compatible [[agoras]] are expected to assemble into a greater federated [[agora network]] where they can fork and merge as wanted.
      - [[agoras]] must communicate clear [[goals]].
