- a [[protocol]].
  - A series of conventions that sentient beings can agree to follow while trying to communicate optimally for the [[common good]].
    - A series of explicit assertions.
    - Announced customarily in [[schelling points]].
    - Extended through [[agora rfcs]].
    - With such a [[protocol]] we can build ([[provision]]?) a common [[pattern language]] and bootstrap a global [[knowledge commons]].
      - An [[Agora]] is a [[repository]] of [[patterns]].
  - A [[flancian]] uses [[Agora Protocol]] to try to define their [[intents]] publicly and cooperate with others optionally for the benefit of beings, but all aspects of Agora and Flancia are meant to be fully optional.
    - I am a [[Flancian]] and this Agora contains my [[manifesto]].
- a [[document]].
	- #go https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JdaC_9J0uYFNFp7g7x4VNtMxJSZQsE2MQkOMmydLCCc/edit
	- Trying to [[bootstrap]] the above [[protocol]].
    - Plus a roadmap for a [[platform]] or federated [[network]] making use of it.
    - #pull [[agora paper]].
  - In [[an agora]], [[agora protocol]] is meant to enable people to exchange [[resources]] mapping to [[patterns]] in a (by default) free global [[commons]], which I also call the Agora for short. 
    - This Agora is a [[knowledge commons]] but seeks to enable [[communities]] to bootstrap a physical [[commons]] to provision for their needs as well.
  - [[meta]]
    - I started with [[google docs]] in 2019/2020 and then I tried moving to [[hedgedoc]] but actually I think I might just go back to the [[google doc]]. It's just a rich experience, and several potential collaborators already use it (they left comments).
    - Update (2022): revamping now ocassionally while writing [[agora pkg chapter]], but it may be that the source of truth becomes [[agora paper]].
- a social [[convention]].
  - A list of social [[conventions]] and [[assertions]].
	- Focusing on improving the ability to communicate with each other with good intent.
	- [[text based]] to begin with. 
    - This means you can use it anywhere you can write down text by default.
    - Using this basic quality, we can make use of [[adversarial interoperability]] as we want to.
    - [[agora protocol]] can be used everywhere. 
      - It is already used in [[wikis]]. You might as well call it [[wiki protocol]] used in new contexts.
      - You already use it in [[digital gardens]].
      - You can use it in [[books]]. 
        - Books written today with Markdown u[[git]] 
      - In [[email]].
      - In [[chat]] and [[social networks]].
        - -> [[agora plan]]
      - [[Around the web]] in general.
        - -> [[agora ext]]
  - Use of [[agora protocol]] defines an Agora, in the sense that it designates the contexts in which it is used as part of the Agora by default.
  - This [[Agora]] welcomes all [[people]] and [[formats]] a priori.
    - The Agora network welcomes all groups except [[fascists]] and those [[fascist-like]].
	- Agora Protocol in a nutshell: https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1437079533253976066
  - [[layer 0]]
	- [[layer 1]]
    - You can use [[wikilinks]]. This expresses an intention to make use the [[wiki protocol]], of which the Agora is a special case.
		- The reference Agora, in which you are probably reading this, also has some limited [[hashtag]] support.
		- An Agora is any virtual space you can define in any way you want as long as it is [[explicit]] and by default [[public]].
			- Each Agora publishes a set of definitions of intention as expressed by its [[users]].
			- This Agora is [[rational]], [[pro social]] and [[heterarchical]].
- a [[protocol]].
  - for [[federation]].
	- can be bootstrapped with [[agora exchange format]]?
    - #pull [[knowledge commons]]
	- [[plain text]] plus as layer 0 (bootstrapping layer).
		- indented bulleted lists designate a useful [[heterarchy]].
    - [[wikilinks]] and #hashtags at layer 1, plus other link conventions and metadata extensions.
		- successive layers are explicitly discussed through [[agora rfcs]] and settled through a [[governance layer]] called an [[agora]] and defined by convention.
			- agora protocol payloads may be exchanged for knowledge for [[free]] in any designated [[agora]].
			- this [[agora]] is built around a [[pro social]] [[distributed knowledge graph]], that is, a [[social knowledge graph]].
			- see [[go/agora-slides]] for more.
		- to see the communally maintained text of the full protocol, please refer to the [[stoa]] below.
			- [[stoa]] https://stoa.anagora.org/p/stoa
	- a [[protocol]] is a set of explicit conventions that can be followed for a purpose.
		- conventions can be optional or necessary and must be marked as such. The default commitment level for this protocol is [[optional]]. [[use must if you must]].
	- for [[extensions]]:
		- push to or modify [[agora rfcs]].
      - this is as kept by the community agreeing to cooperate on such a list: the community of the [[agora]].
      - #push [[agora]]
        - an [[agora]] is a seed that wants to grow into a [[tree]], and from there into a [[distributed]] network.
        - the [[seed]] of this agora is [[go/agora/git]], defining a [[commons]].
        - [[flancia collective]] is the keeper of https://anagora.org.
        - [[agora bridge]], [[agora server]] contain input (write) and output (read) code respectively.
    - #push [[agoras]]
      - Compatible [[agoras]] are expected to assemble into a greater federated [[agora network]] where they can fork and merge as wanted.
      - [[agoras]] must communicate clear [[goals]].
