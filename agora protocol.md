# Agora Protocol

- a [[protocol]]
	- this [[agora]] is a [[pro social]] [[distributed knowledge graph]].
	- that seeks to achieve optimality w.r.t. exchange of knowledge in a [[social knowledge graph]].
	- [[stoa]] https://stoa.anagora.org/p/stoa
		- or find it below :)
	- for proposed [[extensions]], see [[agora rfcs]].
- a set of [[conventions]]
	- [[the agora is a markup convention]]
	- the [[agora]] you're likely reading thi is just one possible implementation of a platform built on a simple protocol. The protocol is defined in this node as a [[stoa]] (shared document) plus a set of nodes pulled here from around the [[agora]]. 
	- for extensions
		- please propose them in the stoa below
		- or see the list of [[agora rfcs]] as kept by the community agreeing to cooperate on such a list: the community of the [[agora]].
	- the [[agora]] is a seed that wants to grow into a [[tree]], and from there into a [[distributed]] network.
		- an [[agora]] starts with a list of [[gardens]], that is, [[personal knowledge graphs]] as volunteered by its users.
		- compatible [[agoras]] are expected to assemble into [[agora networks]] in the future.
- you are reading this on a particular [[implementation]] of a tools that tries to build on the agora protocol. 
	- that is, this is [[an agora]] -- but just one of many.
	- its root repository is [[go/agora/git]]
		- [[agora server]] is a reference implementation for a server based integrator/[[interlay]].
			- the [[agora server]] repository is [[go/agora-server/git]]
	- the goals of this agora are engineered by its community by contributing to the following nodes: [[goals]], [[do]], [[contract]], [[flancia collective]] and all [[pulled]].
