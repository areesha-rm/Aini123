I decided to start writing in the nodes matching my computers whenever I think of something I'd like to do in them while I don't have them otherwise reachable, or just when I don't want to interrupt my session in another computer to switch to it. Sila is a corp device (meaning it is owned by my employer, Google) so it makes sense to start this experiment writing about it.
