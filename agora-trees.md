# agora trees

- You tell the [[agora]] about a [[tree-structure]] and communicate an intent and the [[agora]] tries to reflect the tree in a medium.
  - You tell it the shape of your nested tmux, vnc, ssh, i3 sessions and it tries to serialize/deserialize/execute as needed to replicate across boots.
