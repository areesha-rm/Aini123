# monks in space
- the ending of [[a canticle for leibowitz]], although bleak, is inspiring. I wonder which other stories of monks in space could exist -- and which ones are in Flancia.
	- I keep thinking of a spaceship (colony ship? space station?) assembled out of [[standard containers]] which communities can choose to organize however they want -- the first ones started by monks but open to the wider community.
	- [[outside, roaring spaceships]]
