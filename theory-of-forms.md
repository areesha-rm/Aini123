# Theory of Forms

- [[go]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms
  - [[quote]] The theory of Forms or [[theory of Ideas]] is a [[philosophical theory]], [[concept]], or [[world-view]], attributed to [[Plato]], that the physical world is not as real or true as timeless, absolute, unchangeable [[ideas]].
  - [[quote]] [[Plato]] speaks of these entities only through the characters (primarily [[Socrates]]) of his [[dialogues]] who sometimes suggests that these Forms are the only [[objects of study]] that can provide [[knowledge]]. The theory itself is [[contested]] from within [[Plato's dialogues]], and it is a general point of [[controversy in philosophy]]. Nonetheless the theory is considered to be a classical solution to the [[problem of universals]].
  - [[quote]] [[Form]] answers the question, "[[What is that]]?" Plato was going a step further and asking what Form itself is.
