- ahoy!
- [[wikidata hackathon]] used [[big blue button]]
- [[push]] [[ahs]]
	- [[metasj]] dedicating more time to it going forward
	- new pitch: trying to simplify
	- a [[locus of focus]]
	- a [[legal]], [[summarized]] and [[annotated]] repository of [[knowledge]]
	- a [[distributed knowledge graph]]

\[ hub \] 

\[ legal \]

\[ perserverant \]

\[ comprehensive \]

\[ summarized and annotated \]:

a space for \[\[synthesis\]\]

\===

  

**Modularity:** 

-   Underlay of sources + pipelines; 

-   Interlay of aggregations and catalogs; 

-   Overlays for search, reading, annotation

**Interlay**: 

 1) Namespace for (articles, concepts, authors)

 - To start: 1M entities, write on read?

 \[identify 100 **disciplines**; top **X** historical + current articles, their authors + cites\] 

 2) 

**Bootstrap**:

-   get the 1m entities from somewhere

-   get X users to show contribution methods by example.Â  Good candidates:

-   reading groups paper/book clubs

-   grad students surveying their discipline

-   informal/out of system students

-   citizen scientists

**Units of contribution:**

 1) choose a discipline, build the "list of 100 historical articles / topics" in it, find sources for it \[sync w fatcat\]

 2) mark papers as \[\[state of the art\]\]

 3) assemble papers into a dependency graph

 4) run or join a \[\[reading club\]\] focusing on an area, a book or a set of papers.

\===

\[\[synthesis\]\]

\[\[hypha\]\] coop

  

IL: A healthy subspace for prosocial entities to outperform walled gardens --> here that maximizes your utility and connection.

  

Deustche Bank famously noted how Elsev is benefitting from a distorted market. (The same applies today to app stores...): [https://notes.knowledgefutures.org/pub/supertanker/release/3](https://notes.knowledgefutures.org/pub/supertanker/release/3)

## [[2021-04-30]]

- [[importance]] 
- [[focus]]
  - for the focus to be sharper, X needs to happen
- [[context]]
- [[push]] [[ahs]]
  - instead of trying to figure out how to solve tangential complexity, a platform to focus on what's the focus of our disciplines
  - a platform for [[scholarship]]
  - what do we need?
    - [[names]] for its components
    - a [[mapping]] from a [[goal]] to all known resources that are known to contribute to the [[goal]], or the other way around
      - this feels like a network plus a [[flow]] problem
    - [[scripts]] that iterate over the data set and take actions
      - reminds me of [[intent based automation]] and [[declarative paradigm]]
