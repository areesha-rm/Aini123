- a [[list]].
  - #pull [[nugget]]
    - a valuable fragment; a piece of information.

In the context of the Agora, I believe every [[node]] is potentially a [[nugget]].

In actuality, only the nodes which are interesting or beautiful to the reader may deserve to be called [[nuggets]]

In the context of a [[Neobook]] as a shared project, for example in the [[Fellowship of the Link]], I believe the following nodes might be considered starting nuggets:

- [[Patterns]]
- [[Neobook]]
- [[Agora]]
- [[Massive Wiki]]
