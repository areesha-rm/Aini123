- a [[list]].
  - #pull [[nugget]]
    - a valuable fragment; a piece of information.

In the context of the Agora, I believe every [[node]] is potentially a [[nugget]].

In actuality, only the nodes which are interesting or beautiful to the reader may deserve to be called [[nuggets]]

In the context of [[neobooks]] as a shared project in the [[Fellowship of the Link]], I believe the following nodes might be considered nuggets:

  - [[Neobook]]
  - [[Agora]]
