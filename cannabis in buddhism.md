# cannabis in buddhism

- [[wp]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_and_religion#Buddhism
  - interesting, I thought [[cannabis]] would conflict with the [[paramitas]], but apparently most [[buddhist]] traditions are open minded about it?
    - many writings single out [[alcohol]] as undesirable
  - the [[dalai lama]] accepts [[medical marijuana]]
