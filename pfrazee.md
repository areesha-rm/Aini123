## [[2021-03-05]]
- Greetings!
- [[ctzn]] and ctzn.one
  - using the hypercore p2p mesh to sync between devices
  - [[hybrid]] between [[federated]] and [[p2p]]
  - [[activitypub]] is more push, this is more pull based
  - as much as possible every action occurs [[on chain]]
    - imagine a [[ban]] action: a moderator adds a [[ban]] record, the computer running the network applies the action if the permissions are there
