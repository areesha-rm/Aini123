## [[2021-03-05]]
- Greetings!
- [[ctzn]] and ctzn.one
  - using the hypercore p2p mesh to sync between devices
  - [[hybrid]] between [[federated]] and [[p2p]]
  - [[activitypub]] is more push, this is more pull based
  - as much as possible every action occurs [[on chain]]
    - imagine a [[ban]] action: a moderator adds a [[ban]] record, the computer running the network applies the action if the permissions are there
- [[vision]]
    - two main ones chasing:
      - [[having a better time on the internet]]
        - would like to lower the [[outrage]] levels
        - easy to picture, hard to get there
      - [[modding culture]]
        - [[minecraft]] + [[social forum]] 
        - what would this look like?
- [[agora]]
- [[differences]] and comments
    - [[acme editor]]: the UI of the editor is all editable
    - approach: "no novel pains in the butt"
    - implementing [[reactions]] soon
- do you need something?
  - step 1: get software to beta
  - step 2: growth -- bring in people
    - success: hockey stick growth, 10-20% mo/mo
  - step 3: fund raise, business model close to wordpress (running infra in people's behalf)
