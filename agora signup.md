# agora signup

- To [[read]] the Agora, you don't need anything but a [[web browser]].
  - This [[Agora]] is fully browsable on <https://anagora.org>.
  - You can add the Agora as a [[search engine]].
- To [[contribute]] to the Agora, first you need to publish your [[digital garden]] or [[content]] elsewhere online. The Agora doesn't host your data, but rather pulls it from a location *you* control and renders it for you and other users; it interlinks it with that of other users.
  - If you know your way around [[git]], [[markdown]] on git is the default format. If you use [[roam]] or a [[roam like]] or you have a notes database, you're almost there. 
  - Whatever participation mechanism you choose, you need to let an Agora [[maintainer]] know where your content is, so it can be pulled and [[integrated]]. We strive to continuously support new sources and formats. 
    - You can send email to signup@anagora.org or reach out to a member of [[flancia collective]] with:
      - The URL of your repo or content.
      - Your desired username.
      - Confirmation that you agree to the Agora's [[contract]] (only the one by the @agora user; other contracts are optional).
    - Alternatively if you know your way around [[git]] you can send a PR for `gardens.yaml` in the Agora repo: [[go/agora]].
  - The Agora wants to be [[maximally inclusive]], but it is in its infancy; it is a [[work in progress]]. If you want to participate and can't, please also send email to signup@anagora.org to let us know.
      - Non-git sources and formats other than [[Markdown]] will be supported in the future; if you store your notes using some other system, please reach out.
      - Through projects such as [[agora twitter integration]], we hope to make the Agora available to anyone that has access to a social network account.
- Please refer to [[agora install]] in case you want to run your own Agora; and to [[agora editor]] for more information on clients.
