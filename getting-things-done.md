# Getting Things Done

- [[GTD]] for short. A [[productivity]] method by [[Paul Allen]].
- It's also a book, which I haven't read; [[Luciana]] has.
- The gist of it:
  - Break down tasks. Be specific.
  - When you go through your backlog, like email, you try to either take any needed action immediately (but only if it's short) or classify for later doing.
