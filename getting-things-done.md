# Getting Things Done

- [[GTD]] for short. A [[productivity]] method by [[David Allen]].
- It's also a book, which I haven't read; [[Luciana]] has.
- [[go]] 
- https://hamberg.no/gtd for an intro.
- The gist of it:
  - Break down tasks. Be specific.
  - When go through your backlog, like email, you try to either take any needed action immediately (but only if it's short; perhaps set a threshold in seconds, rather than minutes) or classify for later doing.
  - You classify according to [[time]] and [[context]] for the task of doing. Some example tags:
    - [[next action]], [[next week]], [[some day]], [[office]], [[home]], [[project]].
  - [[next action]] is where the magic happens. At some point something needs to be your [[next action]] to get done :)
- I'm trying using [[Getting Things Done]] in the [[Agora]]:
  - Actions are wikilinks (I don't distinguish between links and tags; they're all just nodes).
  - [[read]], [[research]], [[write]].
  - [[next action]].
  - [[dome day]].
  - [[agora plan]].
- [[do]] acts as an index/root node; whenever I don't know what to do, I just visit [[do]] :)
