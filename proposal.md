# Proposal

- #pull [[proposition]]
- Let's implement [[basic income]] in the [[fediverse]].
  - What is the [[fediverse]]? I say it's the [[federated]], [[cooperative]], [[free internet]].
    - The [[Agora]] tries to be a cross-platform integrator and governance platform for the wider internet ecosystem. It takes the shape of a [[knowledge commons]].
    - See also: my [[plan]].
  - I think [[Elon Musk]] could get behind:
    - [[basic income]] (initially not universal), maybe in the form of [[grants]] fully compatible with late stage capitalism
    - Twitter becoming a part of the [[federation]]. It makes business sense IMHO.
      - Because of [[Star Trek]] it will also get people to think about reactors and rockets.
