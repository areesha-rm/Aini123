# Make up Links That Dont Exist Yet

- The [[internet]] lets you make up and use (post) links that don't exist yet. If you craft them right, you can create them and make them useful later.
  - This is an [[optimist]] use of the internet.
    - I believe it has [[potential]].
    - [[pull]] [[optimistic]] [[thinking]] [[utopia]].
- This works much better when using platforms with [[sensible urls]].
- It is my [[objective]] that the [[agora]] supports any social conventions useful for this purpose. 
- [[pull]] [[writing down links that don't exist yet]].
