# Make up Links That Dont Exist Yet

- The [[internet]] lets you make up and write down (post) links that don't exist yet. If you craft them right, you can just create them later.
  - This is feasible only with platforms with [[sensible urls]].
    - The [[agora]] tries to support the use of social conventions for cross-linking and shared discovery we can use while we exercise this craft of [[writing down links that don't exist yet]].
  - This is an [[optimist]] use of the internet.
    - I believe it has [[potential]].
    - [[pull]] [[optimistic]] [[thinking]], [[utopia]].
