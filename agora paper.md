# Abstract

In this [[paper]] we describe an **Agora**, a [[social knowledge graph]] provisioned and maintained by a self-governing community as a [commons](https://anagora.org/commons). 

The Agora [[knowledge graph]] can be defined as a **hypergraph** `A` with a set of `k` **nodes** `N` (entities an Agora knows about) integrated out of **subnodes** `SN_0 .. SN_k` containing **subedges** `SE_0 .. SE_k`, aggregating into **edges** `E_0 .. E_k` (semantic links between entities inferred out of known subnodes). Edges are annotated implicitly by link context and explicitly via the use of [[agora protocol]], which is extensible and tries to build on existing conventions in the [[personal knowledge management]] space. 

An Agora differs from other projects in the personal knowledge space in a few ways: whereas a **personal knowledge graph** usually contains resources authored or collected by a single person, and a **wiki** usually contains resources produced by a group, an Agora contains, integrates and interlinks both personal and group resources. Whereas links in a personal knowledge graph or wiki usually have a single target, **Agora links fan out by default** and can be thought of as mapping to sets of resources. This is consistent with the general design principle of facilitating storage and retrieval of entity-mapped information towards removing friction from cooperation.

Building on the general principles above and a [[free software]][^reference] reference implementation of the underlying protocols and data, we model and detail how to implement a distributed system that provisions social knowledge services ethically and sustainably, upholding [[data sovereignty]] principles. We then analyze some of the potential applications of such a system. Finally, we shortly explore future work and social implications assuming that the Agora is run as a [[confederated]] system for the [[public good]].

[^reference]: The provided [[reference Agora]] tries to remain tool, format and platform agnostic, building on general conventions common to many tools and platforms in the knowledge space for ease of integration and maximal inclusivity[^inclusivity] and diversity[^diversity]. 

[^inclusivity]: because we require from would-be Agora contributors only that they indicate where to source their notes, and we are committed to supporting all useful formats, we hope to achieve maximal inclusivity. We believe this is important for the health of the [[commons]].

[^diversity]: we believe diverse groups and communities are healthier, smarter, safer, stronger.
