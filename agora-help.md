# Agora Help

- An Agora is a [[distributed knowledge graph]] made up of notes, images, files, links.
- An Agora is built and maintained by a community according to its base [[CONTRACT]].
- Agora nodes are identified by their [[wikilink]]. [[wikilink]]s may resolve to more than one piece of content; this is not only fine, but considered desirable.
- Agora users volunteer content for nodes. Content is shown at that node, sequentially, according to a community maintained [[ranking algorithm]].
- What you're reading currently is a node like any other. If you contributed to this Agora, you could write and submit a note titled 'Agora Help' of your own and it would be shown in this location together with this one.
- If you would like to contribute to the Agora, there are two ways you can do that:
  - You can start taking notes, or assembling a [[digital garden]], and contribute them to the Agora. For more information on how to do this, please refer to the [Agora Howto](https://flancia.org/go/agora-howto).
  - You can help develop the Agora; the Agora is open source and community driven. For more information on how to do this, please refer to [README](https://flancia.org/go/agora-server/README.md)
