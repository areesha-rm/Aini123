# Agora Help

- This is a node like any other. If you would like to contribute to this, just write a note titled 'agora help' (or similar) and it will be shown here.
- If you would like to contribute to the Agora, there are two ways you can do that:
  - You can start taking notes, or assembling a [[digital garden]], and contribute them to the Agora. For more information on how to do this, please refer to the [Agora Howto](https://flancia.org/go/agora-howto).
  - You can help develop the Agora; the Agora is open source and community driven. For more information on how to do this, please refer to [server/README](https://flancia.org/go/agora/server/README.md)
