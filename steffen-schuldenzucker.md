    - [[steffen]] did some during earlier studies -- perhaps it was too early. Later in studies it came very handy.

    - it's useful because you can map betwen categories

          - can you query a [[link path]] between two nodes

        - [[flancian]] they endorsed [[palantir]] publicly, that is worrying to me
  - [[goals]]
- [[m prime]]
