- I want to [[collimate]] my reflector telescope for the first time; these are some notes taken while doing that.
- I got two tools for this purpose:
  - a [[cheshire]] eyepiece
  - a laser collimator
- I first put the cheshire eyepiece and I saw something that was clearly not aligned (that's good, that's why we're here).
  - At first glance I'm unsure if I'm supposed to align first the overall picture (guided by the 'crosshairs' of the secondary mirror I can see) or align the image within the secondary mirror.
  - It is hard to explain what I'm seeing without a drawing, it is really quite complex. I guess this is why collimation guides are a thing.

  - my telescope looked exactly like the first diagram that says 'before collimation', which is good.
  - (stuff happened)
  - I think it's more collimated now than before but not perfect :) still, I want to see the difference next time I observe Jupiter or a star, and it's been cloudy.
    - Maybe I'll observe the distant LEDs in a construction crane ~500m away.
