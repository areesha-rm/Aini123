  - Add plus button that just creates an individual pad that you control? e.g. node-name_timestamp? node-name_hash?
    - This could be as simple as:
      - Add button that adds a div with an embed and scrolls to it
      - Make it so that the agora queries pads as subnodes? Or, actually better: set up a process that dumps stoas to markdown.
