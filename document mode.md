- a [[mode]].
  - more generally, you know, just writing [[long form]].

Like this: writing full sentences and then paragraphs and then maybe chapters and so on.

I feel like I've fallen out of the practice of writing text long form, partly because of social media (I'm really into [[Twitter]], [[Mastodon]] as you might know) and partly because of [[outliner mode]] in [[Logseq]], one of my preferred tools for note taking.
