- What is [[logseq]]'s [[document mode]]? I sort of want it to be a mode in which I can write free form [[markdown]] and have it let it be, without adding bullet points like in [[outliner mode]].
  
  Let's see if it's that :)
  
  # This is a Markdown heading.
  
  ## This is another Markdown heading.
  
  This is a paragraph within that second heading.
  
  Hmm, judging from the error message this is more likely to be all somehow embedded in a single block (?).
