# agora polls

- a [[project]].
  - the [[agora]] can track [[polling]] intents across social networks, and integrate them.
    - [[social media]] provides an ideal platform for opinion polling leading to governance
    - it is under-exploited due to the [[walled garden]] problem
    - federated polling is not only easy to implement, it is also something I believe humanity must have that could lead to significant [[reform]]
  - [[features]]
    - poll cross posting through [[moa.party]]
    - embedding of poll instances in different social networks in a shared [[context]]
    - poll [[boosting]]
    - [[repeating polls]] work around 7d limits on [[mastodon]] and [[twitter]]
