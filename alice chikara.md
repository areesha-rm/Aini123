- [[san francisco]] [[oxford]]
  - [[digital nomad]]
- [[capital markets]]
  - [[information discovery]] [[collaborative learning]]
- interested in [[agora]] cooperation/convergence
- there is so much content being produced; knowledge content in particular
  - on a macro level:
    - information overload
    - content explosion
      - twitter
      - substack
    - no way to discover, manage and learn from it in a collaborative way
      - -> [[lucid]]
    - [[collaborative learning]]
      - [[annotations]]
  - on a micro level:
    - you might need to cater to a community / build for them
    - then there are domain specific concerns
- let's say you have [[product managers]], [[engineers]] trying to do collaborative learning
  - in stack overflow there are no checked sources
  - [[lucid]] has a [[database]] of reliable resources
    - example: SCs for companies provides the database as the mvp is about capital markets
- [[twitter]]
  - [[thread helper]]
    - what if this approach could be extended to link to other (domain specific) databases
- [[annotations]]
  - [[hypothesis]]
  - [[memex]]
- [[agora]]
  - [[agora search]]
  - [[go links]]
- Alice uses [[notion]]
  - tried [[hypothesis]] but didn't like the UX too much
    - search is meh
    - twitter search is also broken
    - lucid tries to have better search
  - tried [[memex]], better UX, unsure about their approach to profit/open source
- Alice's vision: give equity to the community
  - [[exit to community]]
- [[next time]] / discuss:
  - [[codex]]
  - [[leah houston]]
  - [[digital gardeners]]
  - shared [[directories]]
  - higher level knowledge federation / [[agora]]
  - [[flancia collective]]
