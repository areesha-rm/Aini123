# An Open Letter to an Open Nation

A [[letter]].

I am writing this not because I want to, but because I feel like I have to. I want to do it, too, of course; or at least I want to write the ideal version of it, the entelechia, the spirit of a thing that I've learnt to aspire to but I cannot quite grasp. If you put up with me, I'll tell you all about it, and you can decide which letter you would have liked to read and you maybe could write.
