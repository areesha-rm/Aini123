# An Open Letter to an Open Nation

A [[letter]].

I am writing this not because I want to, but because I feel like I have to. I want to do it, too, of course; or at least I want to write the ideal version of it, the entelechia, the spirit of a thing that I've learnt to aspire to and I try to grasp but I cannot quite hold. 

If you put up with me long enough, I'll tell you all about it, and you will be able to decide which letter you would have liked to read instead and you maybe could write.
