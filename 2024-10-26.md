- Well, I'm here finally :)
  - I received my second keyboard and I installed it on the desk with [[Paramita]].
  - Typing on it feels amazing, and the workstation is now set up in a way that I think will entice me to write more often and for longer periods before context switching.
  - I find that, when I'm typing on a laptop keypad, the constant availability of the trackpad makes me context switch more often, as I react impulsively to notifications for example. When I am in this typing position, switching to a different context requires me to:
    - Reach out for the mouse, which is 30cm away.
    - Use a combination like Meta + hjkl to move to a different window using my [[window manager]]'s shortcut, which usually means I'd be focusing to a different window that I had decided I wanted to work on (as it's on my workspace)
    - Learn the shortcut for 'react to last notification', which I don't know and I don't intend to learn today :)
  - Now only remains the task of remembering what I want to do, which means updating my priority list and gathering an intent to follow it.

So today I want to work/play on:

- [[Agora development]]
  - Toggle for autopull in the burger menu I've been playing with in a branch
- [[Flancia]]
  - Zine writing
  - [[Open letter to our readers of the future]] / [[Maitreya]]
  - And leaders of course :)

I also met a new friend, [[Elena]], picked up the keyboard package and mailed out some forms, and thought about some personal matters/emotionally processed.

-> [[do]]
  - I enjoyed going through it a lot actually, several things got marked done! Wow.
  - It makes sense because I *do* follow a kind of system within my chaos, but it's cool to see it corroborated.
  - Some things I actually did; some things are no longer relevant, e.g. Twitter bot stuff (as Musk killed that, for now at least).
  - Which led me to [[maybe Musk will wake up]]
