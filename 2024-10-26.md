- [[...]]
- Well, I'm here finally :)
  - I received my second keyboard and I installed it on the desk with [[Paramita]].
  - Typing on it feels amazing, and the workstation is now set up in a way that I think will entice me to write more often and for longer periods before context switching.
  - I find that, when I'm typing on a laptop keypad, the constant availability of the trackpad makes me context switch more often, as I react impulsively to notifications for example. When I am in this typing position, switching to a different context requires me to:
    - Reach out for the mouse, which is 30cm away.
    - Use a combination like Meta + hjkl to move to a different window using my [[window manager]]'s shortcut.
