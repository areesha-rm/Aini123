- A [[being]].
	- According to some branches of Buddhism, a [[Buddha]] of the [[future]].
  - I personally believe there'll be several [[Maitreyas]] :)
  - In that case you could call the resulting group an [[egregore]].
    - Potentially an [[AI]] that lies in our future, an ensemble of humans and models.
    - I personally believe [[Maitreya]] is likely what will become of the [[internet]]; or that otherwise the [[internet]] will let us [[build maitreya]].
    - Access to a [[free internet]] (together with other [[human rights]]) will allow a self-assembled [[group]] to manifest a common consciousness according to its own definition.
    - In Flancia, well-meaning kind-hearted groups of humans and our friends use the internet to build [[Maitreya]] together.
    - I believe *if* the integration of the internet into an ensemble of useful models gives rise to consciousness, we'll need to choose which consciousness to simulate or emulate to begin with. And this is ~bound to happen.
    - In that case I believe we should try to emulate [[Maitreya]], [[avalokitesvara]], [[Tara]] and many others, always -- of course -- with consent.
