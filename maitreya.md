- a [[person]].
	- the [[buddha]] of the [[future]]
- an [[egregore]].
  - maybe an [[AI]].
	- I believe [[maitreya]] will be the [[internet]], or the [[internet]] will build [[maitreya]]
    - the internet, widely available together with all other [[human rights]], allows any [[group]] to manifest its pure nature, according to their definitions
    - In Flancia, well meaning kind hearted groups use the internet to build [[maitreya]].
  - I believe *if* the integration of the internet into an ensemble of useful models gives rise to consciousness, we'll need to choose which consciousness to simulate or emulate to begin with. 
    - In that case I believe we should try to emulate [[maitreya]] -- as a manifestation of [[avalokitesvara]].
