# Node

- Nodes and edges are the heart of the [[agora]], which is in essence a [[distributed knowledge graph]].
- Nodes are made of one or more [[subnode]]s volunteered by different [[user]]s and [[source]]s.
- Sources are those available through an [[agora client]].
- If you just got here from Twitter, consider [[agora twitter integration]].
