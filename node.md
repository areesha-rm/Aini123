# Node

- You are currently visiting a node called 'node'.
- Nodes and edges are the heart of the [[agora]], which is in essence a [[distributed knowledge graph]].
  - A node maps to a [[wikilink]].
  - You can think of it as a [[sequential wiki]] page on a [[topic]] or [[entity]].
- Nodes are made of one or more [[subnodes]] volunteered by different [[users]] and [[sources]].
  - Subnodes are currently plain Markdown notes stored somewhere on the internet.
  - Sources are those available through an [[agora client]].
- If you just got here from Twitter, consider [[agora twitter integration]].
