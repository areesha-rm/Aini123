# Node

- You are currently visiting a [[thing]] called 'node'.
  - The [[Agora]] is about [[edges]] and [[nodes]].
  - An [[agora]] node is a crowdsourced [[set]] of resources page on a [[topic]] or [[entity]].
    - [[resources]] are known as [[subnodes]].
  - Nodes and edges are the heart of the [[agora]], which is in essence a [[distributed knowledge graph]].
    - A node maps to a [[wikilink]].
  - Nodes contain one or more [[subnodes]] volunteered by different [[users]] and [[sources]].
    - Subnodes are currently plain Markdown notes stored somewhere on the internet.
    - Sources are those available through an [[agora client]].
    - TLDR: If you volunteered a Markdown note called node.md to this Agora, it would show up here like mine.
  - If you just got here from Twitter, consider [[agora twitter integration]].
