# Node

- an [[action]].
  - To contribute to a [[node]].
    - (Each contribution a [[subnode]] by default.)
- a [[thing]].
  - You are currently *in* a [[node]].
    - The [[Agora]] is about [[nodes]] and [[edges]] -- the connections they have, explicitly labeled, modelling how the nodes are related.
    - This text you're reading is a [[subnode]] of node 'node' in this Agora; meaning it is a [[resource]] (a file) named after it, and thus assumed by the Agora to be *about* it or relevant to it.
    - An [[agora]] node is a crowdsourced [[set]] of resources page on a [[topic]] or [[entity]].
        - #push [[agora rfcs]]
          - being [[nodes]], [[subnodes]] should have their own [[subnodes]].
          - they currently don't; the Agora models one level only. but that could change.
    - Nodes and edges are [[the heart of the agora]], which is, I believe, in essence a [[commons]] built upon a [[distributed knowledge graph]].
      - A node maps to a [[wikilink]] or #hashtag.
      - Nodes are sets that contain [[subnodes]] volunteered by different [[users]] and tracked as [[sources]].
      - Subnodes are currently plain Markdown notes stored somewhere on the internet.
      - Sources are those available through an [[agora client]].
      - TLDR: If you volunteered a Markdown note called node.md to this Agora, it would show up here like mine.
    - If you just got here from Twitter, consider [[agora twitter integration]].

    - A node is one of the components of a [[graph]].
  - an [[action]]
    - to [[maintain]] [[nodes]] in the [[agora]]; to contribute notes or other content.
