# Action

- An [[action]] is a verb, wikilinked, that is included in a block and triggers some behaviour in the [[agora]] or some related tool.
- Supported actions as of [[2021-01-07]]:
  - [[go]]
  - [[pull]]
- See also: [[do]], for actions most often performed by humans.
- [[pull]] [[agora action]] [[actions]]
- [[2020-01-12]]
  - [[push]] is the action that links [[2020-01-12]] and [[day]]: because 2020-01-12 includes a block with [[push]] [[day]], [[day]] gets the children of that block as content.
  - [[action]] accordingly gets these blocks as a result of the push above.
