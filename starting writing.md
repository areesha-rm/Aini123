# starting writing

Where do I start writing? As I write in the Agora I feel like I might be finding it harder and harder to know where to start individual pieces, and where to end them; it might have to do with the fact that I've spent the last two years focused on cross-linking (building relationships) more than in longer form writing. Perhaps this focused has reshaped my brain somewhat; or perhaps writing has always been hard, and this is just a [[narrative]].
