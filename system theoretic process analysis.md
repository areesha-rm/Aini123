- a [[technique]]
	- for [[hazard analysis]]
	- by [[nancy leveson]] and [[john thomas]]
	- [[pull]] [[stpa handbook]] [[stpa workshop]]
	- [[push]] [[stpa]]
		- i love how STPA defers key steps to a later stage so they can be done systemically, once partial but complete initial modeling has taken place.
		- can be applied recursively.
	- 4 [[steps]]
		- define the purpose of the analysis, including [[losses]], [[scope]], [[hazards]], [[constraints]] (optionally derived also from [[sub hazards]]).
		- model the control structure
	- step one: define the purpose of the analysis
		- start with the [[losses]], which involve something of value to stakeholders
		- continue by defining the [[scope]] of the system
		- find [[hazards]], which are systemic states or conditions to be prevented, and which together with (worst-case) environmental conditions lead to [[losses]].
			- [[hazards]] + [[environmental conditions]] -> [[losses]]
		- find [[system level constraints]]. 
			- they can look like [[hazards]], inverted.
			- or define how the system must [[minimize losses]] in case the hazards occur.
		- optionally find [[sub hazards]], which might also help define further constraints
