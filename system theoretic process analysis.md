		- start with the [[losses]], which involve something of value to stakeholders
		- continue by defining the scope of the system
		- find [[hazards]], which are systemic states or conditions to be prevented, and which together with (worst-case) environmental conditions lead to [[losses]].
			- [[hazards]] + [[environmental conditions]] -> [[losses]]
