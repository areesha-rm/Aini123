    - [[topic]] [[book club]]
    - you could suggest highly relevant "[[branches]]" -- other books that touch on [[family]] and then [[tribe]]
  - "writing [[reviews]] seems like an artificial way to talk about a book"
    - [[topic]] [[dialogue]] format
  - [[goal]] reduce [[cognitive load]]
- [[recommendation]] [[frode hegland]] [[augmented text]]
- [[engagement graph]]
- [[gamification]] can be used for [[good]]
