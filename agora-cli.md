# Agora Cli

- The [[agora]] [[command line interface]].
- Currently very simple :) Example usage follow.
  - ```foo```
    - goes to node [[foo]]. Note that this is equivalent to search (in the [[agora]], non-existent nodes are search nodes).
  - ```go foo```
    - activates [[go link]] in [[foo]], that is, redirects to the target URL if the go link exists.
- [[pull]] [[cli]]
