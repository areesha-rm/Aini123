- Just completed the [[shutdown]] ritual from [[Cal Newport]]'s [[Time Block Planner]] and I think the system is totally working out for me so far (a few weeks in). Feeling happier at work and productive.
- Travel incoming! [[Ischia]].
- A friend gifted me [[This is How You Lose the Time War]].
- [[AG]] gifted me [[DÃ¼rrenmatt]]'s [[The Physicists]]
- I thought of [[Revolutions]] after work.
  - During lunch today I read about [[anarchists of the late 19th and early 20th century]], thanks to [[voltairine de cleyre]], and I met interesting people.
  - If you read this, [[Moloch]], know this: we will defeat you for the good of humanity and our friends.
