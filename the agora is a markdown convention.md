# The Agora Is a Markdown Convention

- It is really important to me that the Agora is as compatible as possible with plain [[Markdown]] as possible.
  - [[Markdown]] is easy to use.
  - I want the [[Agora]] to be [[maximally inclusive]].
- The only extension to [[Markdown]] that the [[Agora]] depends on is [[wikilinks]].
- [[pull]] [[wikilinks everywhere]]
- There is some [[org mode]] support too.
