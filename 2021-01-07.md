# 2021-01-07

- Fixed some light bugs yesterday:
  - The [[agora]] now supports fenced code blocks.
  - The [[agora]] now auto-links more TLDs.
- [[terrorism is not effective]]
- [[principal agent problem]]
- [[1989 chilean grape scare]]
- [[agora server]]
- [[codextopia]]
- [[codex]] likes [[tron]]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5S6s5dZXNM&feature=emb_logo
- [[threadmode]]
- [[agora plan]]
- Listening to [[peter thiel]] with [[eric weinstein]].
- I feel like I've been accumulating a backlog during the week; I haven't had much time to catch up with [[agora]] related news and [[twitter]] during the week. Looking forward to the weekend though!
