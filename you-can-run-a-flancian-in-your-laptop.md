# you can run a flancian in your laptop

- [[tweets]] [[2021-06-01]]
- only in the sense of running a model of myself as I'm sitting in front of my computer.
- essentially: I'll make memory states of my personal laptop open, and include models in different levels of abstraction.
  - git repositories with code and data I use
  - VMs
  - window manager state, including which programs I'm running and (pending program support) which content it's loaded in them
    - currently including browser tabs.
  - state at different levels can be restored optionally
- [[pull]] [[project snapshot]]
