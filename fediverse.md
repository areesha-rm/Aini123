# Fediverse

- [[go]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse
  - [[quote]] The Fediverse (a portmanteau of "[[federation]]" and "[[universe]]") is an ensemble of [[federated]] (i.e. interconnected) servers that are used for web publishing (i.e. [[social networking]], [[microblogging]], [[blogging]], or [[websites]]) and file hosting, but which, while independently hosted, can communicate with each other. On different servers (instances), users can create so-called [[identities]]. These identities are able to communicate over the boundaries of the instances because the software running on the servers supports one or more [[communication protocols]] which follow an open standard.
- The [[agora]] tries to be a prosocial member of the fediverse.

  - It will offer up [[agora protocol]] to the ecosystem or whichever open protocol is useful to others.
