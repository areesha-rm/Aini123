  - [[gray noise]]
  - [[pink noise]]
  - [[brown noise]]
  - [[pull]] [[colors of noise]]
- What's your [[favorite color]]?
  - I wonder what [[black]] and [[red]] noise sound like.
    - [[true colours]]
  - My favourite are probably [[white noise]] and [[brown noise]]. They both sound a bit like waterfalls, the second sounding lower pitched like a booming low frequency resonance.
  - It turns out that [[red]] is usually a synonym of [[brown]], which in turn actually means [[brownian]].
