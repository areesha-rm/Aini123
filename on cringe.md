# on cringe

Luciana told me [[Girlpool]] has an interview that was cringey and I've been thinking about it. I haven't seen it, mind you. I've been thinking about it in the abstract, prior to evaluation, as it felt like tackling the modeling prior to seeing it, only informed by Luciana's report, and then seeing it, would be maximally informative.

The cringe or problematic in the [[interview]] comes from the fact that the interviewer, of an older age group than the interviewees, that are around 18 years old at the time of interview and whose songs were written around 16 (say), asks about sexual content.
