  - This particular [[agora]] you're reading this in is just [[an agora]].
    - A [[garden of forking paths]]!
    - This one is a particular implementation, limited in nature by my skills and available time and resources. 
    - I hope there will one day be many better.
  - This [[Agora]] tries to be a [[schelling point]] for [[rational]] [[problem solving]].
  - This Agora contains a list of known [[agoras]].

    - [[an agora]] is run by [[flancia collective]] [[for the benefit of all beings]].
    - An [[Agora]] is like a [[bag of holding]], and it contains among many things [[other agoras]].
