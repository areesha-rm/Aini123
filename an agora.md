# An Agora

- a [[thing]].
  - #go https://anagora.org
  - This particular [[agora]] you're reading this in is just [[an agora]].
    - A [[garden of forking paths]] as [[free software]]!
    - This one is a particular implementation, limited in nature by my skills and available time and resources, of the principles drafted in [[Agora chapter]].
    - I hope there will one day be many better.
  - This [[Agora]] tries to be a [[schelling point]] for [[rational]] [[problem solving]].
  - This Agora contains a list of known [[agoras]].
  - #push [[agoras]]
    - [[an agora]] is run by [[flancia collective]] [[for the benefit of all beings]].
    - An [[Agora]] is like a [[bag of holding]], and it contains among many things [[other agoras]].
- #pull [[Agoras]]
