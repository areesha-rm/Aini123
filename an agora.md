# An Agora

- a [[thing]].
  - [[bag of holding]] [[garden of forking paths]]
  - [[pull]] [[anagora]]
  - [[push]] [[agoras]]
    - [[go]] https://anagora.org
    - run by [[flancia collective]]
  - this particular [[agora]] is just [[an agora]].
    - this is just one particular implementation, limited in nature by my personal skills and the lack of time and resources. I hope there will one day be many better.
    - this [[agora]] tries to be a [[schelling point]] for [[rational]] [[problem solving]].
    - this Agora contains a the set of known [[agoras]].
      - It tries to [[list]] and optionally [[integrate]] them.
