# An Agora

- a [[thing]], a [[place]].
  - You find yourself in.
  - #go https://anagora.org
  - This particular [[agora]] you're reading this in is just [[an agora]].
    - A [[garden of forking paths]] as [[free software]]!
    - [[This Agora]] is a particular implementation, limited in nature by my skills and available time and resources, of the principles drafted in [[Agora chapter]].
    - I hope there will one day be many better than this one, implementing the same and similar ideas -- in good spirit.
  - #push [[Agoras]]
    - This [[Agora]] is run by [[Flancia Collective]] [[for the benefit of all beings]].
    - This [[Agora]]'s current policy is: to try to become a [[Schelling Point]] for [[rational]] [[problem solving]] activities.
  - This Agora tries to contain a good list of known well-meaning [[agoras]].
    - You could say an [[Agora]] is like a [[bag of holding]] :)
