# An Agora

- a [[thing]], a [[place]].
  - You find yourself in.
  - #go https://anagora.org
  - This particular [[agora]] you're reading this in is just [[an agora]].
    - A [[garden of forking paths]] as [[free software]]!
    - I hope there will one day be many better than this one, implementing the same and similar ideas -- in good spirit.
  - This [[Agora]]'s current policy is: trying to become a [[Schelling Point]] for [[rational]] [[problem solving]] activities.
  - [[This Agora]] is a particular implementation, limited in nature by my skills and available time and resources, of the principles drafted in [[Agora chapter]].
  - #push [[agoras]]
    - [[an agora]] is run by [[flancia collective]] [[for the benefit of all beings]].
    - An [[Agora]] is like a [[bag of holding]], and it contains among many things [[other agoras]].
  - This Agora tries to contain a good list of known well-meaning [[agoras]].
    - #pull [[Agoras]]
