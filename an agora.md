    - An [[Agora]] is a [[bag of holding]]
  - #push [[agoras]]
    - [[an agora]] is run by [[flancia collective]] [[for the benefit of all beings]].
  - This particular [[agora]] you're reading this in is just [[an agora]].
    - (a [[garden of forking paths]].)
    - this is just one particular implementation, limited in nature by my personal skills and the lack of time and resources. I hope there will one day be many better.
    - this [[agora]] tries to be a [[schelling point]] for [[rational]] [[problem solving]].
    - this Agora contains a the set of known [[agoras]].
      - It tries to [[list]] and optionally [[integrate]] them.
