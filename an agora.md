# An Agora

- a [[thing]]
  - a [[bag of holding]].
- this particular [[agora]] is just [[an agora]].
  - [[push]] [[agoras]]
    - [[go]] https://anagora.org
    - this [[agora]] is a [[schelling point]].
    - This is just one particular implementation, limited in nature by my personal skills and the lack of time and resources. I hope there will one day be many better.
    - [[meta]] this Agora contains a description of the [[set of all agoras]]. It tries to [[list]] and optionally [[integrate]] all known.
