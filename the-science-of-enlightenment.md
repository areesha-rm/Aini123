# The Science of Enlightenment

- Epigraph by [[T. S. Eliot]]:
  - "We shall not cease from exploration / And the end of all our exploring / Will be to arrive where we started / And know the place for the first time."
- A [[book]] by [[shinzen young]].
- I'm not sure yet exactly how much [[science]] there is in it; [[shinze young]] has collaborated with neuroscientists for sure, and is well trained, but I've read some [[criticism]] that says he sometimes uses the "language" of science without applying the spirit.
- I like it so far in any case.
