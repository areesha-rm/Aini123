# Daily

- [[meditate]] for at least one minute now.
- [[think]] about how to make my future [[self]] and others glad.
- [[think]] about long term goals:
  - [[fight procrastination]]: 
    - Update (2024): I think this fight is well advanced :) It still takes me too long to do some things, but I think I've gotten a lot better at prioritizing and a lot of the time when something does take me long it ends up being because 1. it is quite difficult (so it just literally takes time to do) or 2. I am balancing it with a lot of other things, so it makes sense it takes me a while to get to it.
  - [[help others]]:
    - Update (2024): I have been quite involved in subsets of [[Effective Altruism]] in the last few years. Recently I ramped down some of my recurring donations to prepare for a [[new economic reality, but I remain committed to donating a significant chunk of my income.
  - Build an [[Agora]].
  - Write [[Flancia]].
  - Learn [[useful]] and [[interesting]] things.
  - [[Maintain my body]].
- Find and allocate time to continue my meditation practice. 
  - Write down the time now. Default: one hour after starting on this daily routine.
- #go https://edit.anagora.org/daily
- Go over tasks: [[do]].
  - Nudge them lightly as I can towards a state that my future self will appreciate :)
- If it's time, review [[weekly]] in the style of [[weekly reviews]].
  - It's time when it's been more than 7d since the last review.
  - Default: [[sunday]].
