- a genre of [[poetry]].
  - Originally from [[Japan]].
  - with [[31]] syllables!
    - (I like that number.)
   
My first [[tanka]]:

Gone gone (2)
Gone beyond (5)

Everybody gone (10)
to the other shore (15)

Go free (17)
Go kindly (20)

If you have to go (25)
go kindly! (28)

Now awake (31)
  (or: [[meditate]])
