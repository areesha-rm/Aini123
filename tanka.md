- a genre of [[poetry]].
  - Originally from [[Japan]].
  - with [[31]] syllables!
    - (I like that number.)

My first [[tanka]] written:

```
Gone gone (2)
Gone beyond (5)

Everybody gone (10)
to the other shore (15)

Go free (17)
Go kindly (20)

If you have to go (25)
go kindly! (28)

Now awake (31)
  (or: meditate)
```

-- 

My "second":

```
Gone gone! (2)
Gone beyond (5)

Everybody gone (10)
to the other shore (15)

Gone free (17)
Gone kindly (20)

If you have to go (25)
go kindly! (28)

Meditate (31)
```

My third, now dropping quotes :)

```
Gone gone! (2)
Gone beyond (5)

Everybody gone (10)
to the other shore (15)

Gone free (17)
Gone kindly (20)

If you have to burn (25)
burn kindly! (28)

Meditate (31)
```
