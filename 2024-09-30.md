- read about the [[Karmapa]]
- I have this week off, will probably keep today and tomorrow off and resume work on Wednesday
- I crafted, and then went through, a lengthy todo list :)
    - [x] do laundry (2x)
    - [x] donate (2x)
    - [ ] run [[collect]] over todo items/notebooks, they've gotten out of control as usual :)
        - [ ] add items to this todo list or ideally to the [[root node]] for my tasks
        - [ ] maybe add images directly, although that could take time it will be less time than entering manually, and I could pipe the collection to AI at some point? 
    - run
