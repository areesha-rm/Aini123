I know something and yet I forget it all the time. I am surprised by it when I remember it; but immediately I'm more surprised by the fact I have managed to forget it at all.

I've come back to this over and over again, as occurrences piled on occurrences, and finally I've decided that I know what's up. I forget it because I must forget it; if I didn't forget it, I couldn't go on living the way I do. In a way I decide to forget it, but luckily enough it seems I don't decide to forget that I've chose to forget; so here I am, thinking these thoughts, and deciding to write them down; so you can find this thing, and choose to forget it -- or not.

The [[agora]] is not the thing I forget, but points to it.
