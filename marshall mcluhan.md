		McLuhan coined the expression "[the medium is the message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_medium_is_the_message "The medium is the message")" and the term _[global village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_village)_, and predicted the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web "World Wide Web") almost 30 years before it was invented.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan#cite_note-FOOTNOTELevinson1999-11) He was a fixture in media [discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse "Discourse") in the late 1960s, though his influence began to wane in the early 1970s.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan#cite_note-12) In the years following his death, he continued to be a controversial figure in academic circles.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan#cite_note-stille-13) However, with the arrival of the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet") and the World Wide Web, interest was renewed in his work and perspective.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan#cite_note-guard08-14)[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan#cite_note-wired_saint-15)[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan#cite_note-boxer-16)
