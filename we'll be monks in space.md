- a [[short story]].

I tell you, [[we will be monks in space]]. If you want to, anyway; we don't need to have exactly the same lifestyles. But being a monk in space could be compatible with yours.

First, think about it -- monks are only celibate because for most of human history they didn't have safe, effective contraception available. But we do. So we can achieve the same result (no kids that we can't afford, or don't have a direct interest on), while optionally having sex, as long as it's all consensual and constructive.

Now, some monks have a religious zeal in them. Some people may think the best do; but I like to think chill monks do a lot for humanity. And in any interesting group there's heterogeneity. Chill monks can live with chill monks, and intense ones with intense ones, or they can prefer living in complementary groups. Either way it's fine; different spaceships can cultivate different [[cultures]].
