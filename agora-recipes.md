- A platform for crowdsourcing [[recipes]].
- [[push]] [[aip21]]
  - An [[experiment]] or [[mvp]] for both [[agora search]] and [[m prime]].
    - [[m prime]] is a [[problem solving]] [[framework]].
      - A [[recipe]] is a possible [[solution]] to a [[problem]] (you don't have cake yet you want cake; here's how to produce cake).
        - It includes a set of requirements or [[dependencies]].
          - [[time]] and [[ingredients]]. Sometimes [[skill]].
