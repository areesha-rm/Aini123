# Yoga with Adriene

- A [[youtube channel]].
- It is essentially the base of our [[yoga]] practice.
- A [[project]] by [[adriene mishler]].
- [[pull]] [[adriene mishler]]
- I set up [[go links]] for the best/more memorable/more reusable sessions often, although I did that in flancia.org for quite long and not in anagora.org; need to move those go links here probably.
