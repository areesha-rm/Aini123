# Ranking

- Ranking in the [[Agora]] is fully transparent and open.
- Users will be able to customize ranking using the Agora UI eventually. For the time being, users that know Python may code any ranking function -- as the Agora is [[open source]].


[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[Agora]: agora "Agora"
[open source]: open-source "Open Source"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
