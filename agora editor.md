# Agora Editor

- In a nutshell: you need to host your notes (more generally, [[resources]]), defaulting to [[markdown]] plus [[wikilinks]], somewhere else online. And then let the [[agora]] know about it.
	- Most users currently host [[git]] repositories on https://github.com and https://gitlab.com. The Agora doesn't host your data, but rather pulls it from a location *you* control and renders it for you and other users; it interlinks your data with that of other users as you wish.
	- Note this format also lets you easily publish your [[blog]] or [[digital garden]] independently online.
- As of [[2021-05-07]], the recommended Agora editor is 
	- [[foam]], if you want open source.
	- [[obsidian]] if you don't mind using closed software from ethical companies, in particular a small one with a vibrant open source extension community. 
		- You need at least also the [[obsidian git]] plugin.  See [[obsidian plugins]] for more.
	- [[install obsidian]] by visiting https://obsidian.md and then follow [[vault backup]] to set up backup to [[git]]: https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line.
	- Then follow the procedure below to add your vault or [[digital garden]] to the [[agora]].
  - From [[2021-01-03]] until [[2021-05-07]], the recommended Agora editor was [[foam]].
	  - [[foam]] is a [[vscode]] [[extension]].
	  - If those worlds make sense to you, congratulations :) You can use [[foam]].
	- You can also use:
	  - [[dendron]], which should be a drop-in [[foam]] replacement in [[vscode]].
	  - [[roam]] plus [[roam2agora]]
	  - [[org mode]]
	  		- [[experimental]]
	  - [[jekyll]] and other static site generators
	  - In essence, all you really need to use the [[Agora]] is the capability to produce text in some format and make it publicly available somewhere. 
		  - As mentioned earlier I use [[obsidian]] to produce and manage my notes, and [[git]] to store them online, but the [[agora]] tries to be maximally inclusive; if you want to publish your writing to this Agora, please reach out!
- After getting yourself a [[digital garden]], you need to let an [[agora]] know about it so it can be pulled and integrated. Please send a [[pr]] adding your garden to [[gardens yaml]] or reach out to a maintainer with a link to your git repository and your desired username.
	- All [[agora]] users must agree to its [[contract]] as defined by the system account.
	- The contracts of other users can optionally be a [[endorsed]].
- Please reach out if you have questions or suggestions :) 
	- Send email to signup@anagora.org, or DM [[flancian]] or another member of the [[flancia collective]] on Twitter, Mastodon, or any other platform.
- My proposal for you now is that we used the internet-given capability of sharing text and media with others at effectively zero cost and agree on a protocol to communicate optimally.
	- [[pull]] my proposal is the [[agora protocol]].
	  - [[the agora is a markdown convention]]
