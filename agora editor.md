# Agora Editor

- In essence, all you really need to use the [[Agora]] is the capability to make Markdown (or just text, really) files publicly available somewhere. I use [[foam]] to produce and manage my notes, and [[git]] to store them online.
- As of [[2021-05-07]], the recommended Agora editor is [[obsidian]].
	- plus the following plugins: [[obsidian git]] [[obsidian natural language dates]]
  - From [[2021-01-03]] until [[2021-05-07]], the recommended Agora editor was [[foam]].
	  - [[foam]] is a [[vscode]] [[extension]].
	  - If those worlds make sense to you, congratulations :) You can use [[foam]].
- You can also use:
  - [[dendron]], which should be a drop-in [[foam]] replacement in [[vscode]].
  - [[roam]] plus [[roam2agora]]
  - [[org mode]] in markdown mode
  - [[jekyll]]
- Or you can reach out :) Send email (I know, how quaint!) to signup@anagora.org, or DM [[flancian]] on Twitter, Mastodon, or any other platform.
