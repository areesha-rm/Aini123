# Entelechy

- "The complete realisation and final form of some [[potential]] concept or function; the conditions under which a potential thing becomes [[actualized]]."
- Related to [[platonic ideal]].
- To me, an [[Agora]] is what the internet could be, if we hold it right! And is thus a form of [[entelechy]].
