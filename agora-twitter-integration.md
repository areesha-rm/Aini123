# Agora Twitter Integration

- [[Twitter]] could integrate with the [[Agora]], or the other way around, in several seemingly productive ways.
- One way would be to automatically pull tweets that use [[wikilink]]s as backlinks in the matching node.
- Another way would be to automatically tweet blocks with [[action]] [[tweet]] for users which added twitter integration, like so:
  - [[tweet]] if you write a block like this, the Agora will tweet it (exactly once, etc.)
  - Probably should support scheduling, throttling, etc.

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[wikilink]: wikilink "Wikilink"
[action]: action "Action"
[tweet]: tweet "Tweet"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
