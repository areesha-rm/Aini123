# Node Permutations

- The [[agora]] will try to serve node permutations if it doesn't have an exactly matching node.
  - That means it will serve this node ([[node permutations]]) in [[permutations node]] as long as there is no valid subnode in the latter.
  - This could be extended -- it could happen also for existing nodes. But it doesn't work like that currently.
