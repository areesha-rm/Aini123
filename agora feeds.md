# Agora Feeds

- a [[feature]].
  - #push [[agora plan]]
    - The [[agora]] should support [[rss]] / [[atom]] feeds in two ways:
      - As a [[consumer]], to easily allow any feed producer to volunteer subnodes in an [[agora]].
        - I see this as part of the [[agora bridge]] effort.
      - As a [[producer]], to easily allow users and other systems to consume [[agora]] updates.
        - As of [[2022]] this exists: 
          - /feed/node gives you a feed of subnodes in node.
          - /feed/latest gives you an Agora wide feed.
  - #push [[python]] libraries
    - most popular: [[feedparser]]
    - new contender: [[atoma]]
