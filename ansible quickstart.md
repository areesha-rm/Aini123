> If you have not already done these things, the quickstart for ansible is (assuming you are on a nix'like os):

> * get set up for server shell access
> * install ansible 2.9 on your local machine (on mac brew install ansible@2.9)
> * Install pass (brew install pass)
> * complete the steps in https://git.coop/social.coop/tech/ansible/-/blob/master/README.md
> * clone the pass repo git clone git@git.coop:social.coop/tech/pass ~/.password-store/
> * test ansible from the locally cloned repoansible-playbook server.playbook.yml --check
