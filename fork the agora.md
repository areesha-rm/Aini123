# fork the agora

- Feel free to [[fork]] this [[agora]].
  - Please keep in mind only two things:
    - Respect the wishes of users that you are carrying with the fork (see [[gardens yaml]]), in particular if you ever change the [[contract]].
    - Agoras may optimistically assemble into a distributed network in the future as long as their contracts don't state an explicit intent against merging.
