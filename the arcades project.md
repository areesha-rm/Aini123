# The Arcades Project
- #push [[arcades project]]
- a [[book]].
	- ...sort of.
		- perhaps closer to a [[hypertext]], before those existed.
			- maybe a [[scrapbook]]. maybe a [[draft]].
	- #push [[walter benjamin]] contemporaries
		- quotes from: [[marcel proust]] [[paul valéry]] [[louis aragon]] [[andré breton]] [[georg simmel]] [[ernst bloch]] [[siegfried kracauer]] [[theodor adorno]]
	- in the words of the translator of our edition, the items on display ([[drafts]], [[excerpts]]) give rise to "[[a world of secret affinities]]".
	- [[benjamin]] abandoned the work in [[1940]] as he had to flee [[paris]].
	- [[benjamin]] wrote to [[gershom scholem]] on [[1934]] and said that "not a syllable of the actual text of the [[passagenarbeit]] exists yet". So perhaps what we've got is essentially only [[notes]] for a work that was never written.
