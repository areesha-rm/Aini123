		- An Agora is a [[distributed knowledge graph]] provisioned and maintained by a community as a [[commons]].
			- Whereas a [[personal knowledge graph]] usually contain resources authored or collected by a single person, and a wiki usually contains resources produced by a community, an Agora is a [[social knowledge graph]] based on the [[integration]] of both personal and group resources.
			- Whereas a [[personal knowledge graph]] is usually maintained using a single [[personal knowledge management]] tool and stored in a single format, an Agora tends to be tool agnostic and support many formats as input.
		- Being a graph, an Agora can be defined as a set of vertexes or [[nodes]] `N` (entities) and [[edges]] `E` (known links between entities, optionally annotated).
			- Agora [[nodes]] are defined by the set of known resources *about* the entity described by their title or other metadata.
				- Put another way, an [[agora node]] is a community maintained [[collection]] of voice-preserving individual contributions by default.
				- Note that Agora nodes in turn to graphs defined in a local context around the [[subnodes]] represented by known resources.
			- Because links between two nodes in an Agora can be [[annotated]] (i.e. #tagged or qualified by other nearby links) and have multiplicity, the Agora is in fact a [[hypergraph]].
			- Individual agoras are expected to federate and organize into greater Agora networks, which are in themselves graph-like at a higher level.
		- On a system level, there exists a [[reference Agora]] that provides a minimum viable implementation for the [[underlay]], [[interlay]], [[overlay]] components of the [[distributed knowledge graph]].
			- We are using said reference Agora to refine the proposed system and run experiments.
			- Some hypotheses that we are testing:
				- A [[knowledge commons]] model can provide utility to participating communities efficiently, as the cost of systemic integrations with a hub design such as the Agora can scale with `O(N)` instead of the `O(N^2)` provided by a naive full mesh.
				- Social convergence on meaning might be sufficient to complement both taxonomic approaches (hierarchical)
