		- An Agora is a [[distributed knowledge graph]] provisioned and maintained by a community as a [[commons]].
			- Whereas a [[personal knowledge graph]] usually contain resources authored or collected by a single person, and a wiki usually contains resources produced by a community, an Agora is a [[social knowledge graph]] based on the [[integration]] of both personal and group resources.
		- Being a graph, an Agora can be defined as a set of vertexes or [[nodes]] `V` (entities) and [[edges]] `E` (known links between entities, optionally annotated).
			- Agora [[nodes]] are defined by the set of known resources *about* the entity described by their title.
				- Put another way, an [[agora node]] is a community maintained [[collection]] of voice-preserving individual contributions by default.
				- Note that Agora nodes generalize in turn to graphs defined in a local context around the [[subnodes]] represented by known resources.
			- Because links between two nodes in an Agora can be  [[annotated]] (i.e. #tagged or qualified by other nearby links), the Agora is in fact a [[hypergraph]].
		- Individual agoras are expected to federate and organize into greater Agora networks, which are in themselves graph-like at a higher level.
