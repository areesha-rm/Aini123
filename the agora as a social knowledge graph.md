		- An Agora is a [[distributed knowledge graph]] provisioned and maintained by a community as a [[commons]].
			- Whereas a [[personal knowledge graph]] usually contain resources authored or collected by a single person, and a wiki usually contains resources produced by a community, an Agora is a [[social knowledge graph]] based on the [[integration]] of both personal and group resources.
		- Being a graph, an Agora can be defined as a set of [[nodes]] (entities) and [[edges]] (links between entities, optionally annotated).
			- Agora [[nodes]] are defined by the set of known resources *about* the entity described by their title.
				- Note that Agora nodes generalize in turn to graphs defined in a local context by the [[subnodes]] represented by found resources.
			- Note that because links can be annotated in an Agora, the Agora is a [[hypergraph]].
