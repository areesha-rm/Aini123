# Yoga

- I'm a fan of yoga.
  - You can think of yoga as the study of healthy movement.
  - You can also think of yoga as a [[graph]] of asanas (healthy body postures), with edges being constructive transitions between them; a yoga session is a particular tour through this graph.
- Yoga has been great for my [[lower back pain]].
- I like [[yoga with adriene]]. 
  - If you'd like to try it out:
    - [[pull]] [[try-yoga]]
- [[go]] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWBfQjuwp4E&list=PLui6Eyny-UzzFFfpiil94CUrWKVMaqmkm
