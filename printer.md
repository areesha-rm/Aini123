# Printer

- A [[device]] with which most people seem to have a conflicted relationship.
- On ([[2020-11-30]]) I checked reviews and [[the wirecutter]] recommends:
  - for b&w: Brother HL-L2350DW -- very similar to what we already have
  - for b&w plus scanner: Brother MFC-L2750DW -- probably a good upgrade, plus it has duplex scanning.
  - for color: HP Color LaserJet Pro M255dw
- Apparently reasonable option for laser colour + scanner: https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/hp-laserjet-pro-m283fdw-wireless-color-all-in-one-laser-printer-white/6401096 for laser co
  - But [[hp]] is often described as evil w.r.t. their policy with expensive toners/ink and bricking unofficial replacements
  - And it doesn't have duplex scanning.
