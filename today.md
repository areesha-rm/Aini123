# Today

- a [[snapshot]].
  - written in a [[moment]] in time, describing a [[duration]] :)
  - [[go]] https://anagora.org/today
  - I keep journal entries, that is, notes with filename `YYYY-MM-DD.md`, in the `journal/` directory.
- IIRC as of the time of writing the [[Agora]] doesn't display this note because /today is overriden to redirect to e.g. [[2024-01-03]] :)
  - [[2024-02-19]] is... today ;)
  - [[2024-07-21]] is today again ;)
  - #push [[todo]]
    - I really should make it so that today pulls itself? but rather also some kind of quote operator, to be able to choose not to render /today as the [[Agora of Flancia]] does by default but in a way that gets node content.
    - /node used to be this, but then I blundered momentarily maybe by making it render the 'raw' node with no [[Agora chrome]] at all?
