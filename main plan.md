There was a person who had so many plans that one day the decided to start a new plan and call it master plan, but then they remembered 'master' was frowned upon due to potential concerns with oppression, so they went and called it [[Main Plan]] for lack of a better term.

- #pull [[plan]] [[agora plan]] [[todo]]
    - The previous sentence means that the Agora you are reading this in will try to include in this context also the content of the topics mentioned, with "pull" being an optional movement metaphor.

So they went and wrote in the main plan:

- #push [[plan]]
    - This is my main plan, the [[root]] of that tree now you could say.

To make things a little bit more complicated and potentially confusing, but hopefully illustrating a point :)

The other day I said I was running 300 projects and I was not exaggerating, at least not in some way. Here in this Agora I keep thousands of plan, each plan a node and each node a plan.

I would like to prioritize advancing the following Agora features:

- [[Fediverse]] cross-posting or further integration
- [[Agora polls]]
    - [[Oauth]] 
- [[Navigation improvements]] 
- [[Agora demo]]
