First up: [[ward cunningham]]! Trends in this space.

Clearcutting the internet. Listen to the wind in the trees. Do not trust someone with a business model, because they will prefer their model to you if they need to.

The internet is more of a park than a shopping mall. We are park builders here.

Vision for [[fedwiki]]: something that is federated but is recognizably a wiki.

You are not succesful if you are not being copied. Who cares if the idea is succesful? That's the foundation of creativity: understanding other ideas and making them your own. Different from a github model, where everybody is working towards the "same ideal code". We want instead a chorus of voices here.

A place in your mind to create: different from just 'remembering' things. Creating collaboratively is amazing.

The most common markup is text + double square brackets. But would like to branch out to many more complex formats; mind maps for example (might have gotten the term wrong here).

Descriptions of intention. Intentions being independently evaluated by a 'robot critic'. Integrated functional testing in the network. [[annotated intentions]].
