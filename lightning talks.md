First up: [[ward cunningham]]! Trends in this space.

Clearcutting the internet. Listen to the wind in the trees. Do not trust someone with a business model, because they will prefer their model to you if they need to.

The internet is more of a park than a shopping mall. We are park builders here.

Vision for [[fedwiki]]: something that is federated but is recognizably a wiki.

You are not succesful if you are not being copied. Who cares if the idea is succesful? That's the foundation of creativity: understanding other ideas and making them your own. Different from a github model, where everybody is working towards the "same ideal code". We want instead a chorus of voices here.

A place in your mind to create: different from just 'remembering' things. Creating collaboratively is amazing.

The most common markup is text + double square brackets. But would like to branch out to many more complex formats; mind maps for example (might have gotten the term wrong here).

[[sami husseni]] freeic.org (in chat)

Descriptions of intention. Intentions being independently evaluated by a 'robot critic'. Integrated functional testing in the network. [[annotated intentions]].

Next up: [[daniel doyon]], co-founder of [[readwise]].

Very few people (<5%) of those that kept book highlights had a way of revisiting their highlights. [[readwise]] fetches all highlights, aggregates and tries to make it so that users revisit them -- daily reminders are sent, etc.

Value proposition evolved into being a place that makes it easy to get all your data/annotations into a single place.

Belief: when the [[pc]] came out, it was immediately better for writing than anything that existed and was analog. Software 'ate' the practice of writing, which includes note taking. What software *didn't* eat was reading; low resolution CRTs weren't better than printed material.

Next: [[bastien guerry]]. Missed the beginning due to technical problems.

Plato's written dialogues.

Writing: both a remedy and a poison. [[pharmakon]].

![[Pasted image 20210622183043.png]]

Models and anti-model. Anti-mode: word documents floating around without versioning.

![[Pasted image 20210622183156.png]]

[[org mode]]!

![[Pasted image 20210622183300.png]]

![[Pasted image 20210622183328.png]]

Single powerful idea: let's write to-do items and notes with the same tool!

![[Pasted image 20210622183447.png]]

"org mode brought folding to the people"

[[dan whaley]]: to the audience. Keep thinking questions for the panel later :) Where is this all headed?

Next up: me! Supposedly. No notes here but slides are on [[go/agora-slides]].

[[oliver sauter]] "in the flow": a case for [[bespoke interoperability]].

"how our future note-taking infrastructure can serve us wherever we are, as a constant companion"

Basic coordination problem.

Some workflows do not require sophisticated processes to be useful.

In the context of [[memex]], they identified the [[creator workflow]]: [[discover]], [[capture]], [[synthesize]], [[share]].

[[emergent interoperability]]

![[Pasted image 20210622185313.png]]

Takeaway: let's prefer emergent patterns to top-down approches.

[[dan whaley]] follows. A [[feature request]] :)

The problem: import/export flows are one way only.

What's needed? Commitment, protocol, APIs, conventions, services and clients.

![[Pasted image 20210622190059.png]]

[[conaw]] is next. "roam is not about note taking". The landing page said that, but it was a matter of saying what people could understand. Working on this since 2008, full time since 2013: "Roam has always been about building a platform for Collective Intelligence".

![[Pasted image 20210622190553.png]]

Moore's law. [[cognitive surplus]].
