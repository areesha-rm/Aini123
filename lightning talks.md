First up: [[ward cunningham]]! Trends in this space.

Clearcutting the internet. Listen to the wind in the trees. Do not trust someone with a business model, because they will prefer their model to you if they need to.

The internet is more of a park than a shopping mall. We are park builders here.

Vision for [[fedwiki]]: something that is federated but is recognizably a wiki.

You are not succesful if you are not being copied. Who cares if the idea is succesful? That's the foundation of creativity: understanding other ideas and making them your own. Different from a github model, where everybody is working towards the "same ideal code". We want instead a chorus of voices here.

A place in your mind to create: different from just 'remembering' things. Creating collaboratively is amazing.

The most common markup is text + double square brackets. But would like to branch out to many more complex formats; mind maps for example (might have gotten the term wrong here).

[[sami husseni]] freeic.org (in chat)

Descriptions of intention. Intentions being independently evaluated by a 'robot critic'. Integrated functional testing in the network. [[annotated intentions]].

Next up: [[daniel doyon]], co-founder of [[readwise]].

Very few people (<5%) of those that kept book highlights had a way of revisiting their highlights. [[readwise]] fetches all highlights, aggregates and tries to make it so that users revisit them -- daily reminders are sent, etc.

Value proposition evolved into being a place that makes it easy to get all your data/annotations into a single place.

Belief: when the [[pc]] came out, it was immediately better for writing than anything that existed and was analog. Software 'ate' the practice of writing, which includes note taking. What software *didn't* eat was reading; low resolution CRTs weren't better than printed material.

Next: [[bastien guerry]]. Missed the beginning due to technical problems.

Plato's written dialogues.

Writing: both a remedy and a poison. [[pharmakon]].

Models and anti-model. Anti-mode: word documents floating around without versinion
