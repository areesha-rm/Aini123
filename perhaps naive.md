This is my perhaps naive take on why [[2021]] was a good year at the same time it was terrible for so many.

First of all, let's spare a minute for those who suffered or didn't make it. Let us do [[loving kindness]] for them and those that remain.

Now let me tell you something. I think things are looking up on a few fronts. 

First, it's becoming evident that humanity needs to learn how to deal with global risk together. It is becoming unavoidable. It will happen, and it seems evident to me that the best way to tackle the problems at hand is to have nation states cooperate at high speed. Efficient pandemics handling is at stake if nation-states first, and arbitrary human groups later, can learn to solve coordination problems.

Second, many died. People know people who died
