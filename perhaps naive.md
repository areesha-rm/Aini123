This is my perhaps naive take on why [[2021]] was a good year at the same time it was terrible for so many.

First of all, let's spare a minute for those who suffered or didn't make it. Let us do [[loving kindness]] for them and those that remain.

Now let me tell you something. I think things are looking up on a few fronts. 

First, it's becoming evident that humanity needs to learn how to deal with [[global risk]] together. It is becoming unavoidable. It will happen out of necessity due to risks that happen to affect also those in positions in power. It seems evident to me that the best way to tackle the problems at hand is to have nation states cooperate at high enough speed. Efficient pandemics handling is at stake: if nation-states first, and arbitrary human groups later, can learn to solve the coordination problems involved in defining rational (and evolutionarily fit) policies on a global scale. Here I see the future as ideally a peaceful showdown between nation-states and competing groups ([[corporations]], [[cooperatives]], [[collectives]]) as they realize the true power of the internet for solving [[coordination problems]].

Second, many died. People know people who died.
