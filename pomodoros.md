- a [[list]].
  - #pull [[do]]
- a [[log]].
	- A place where I can write down meta/thoughts while I do pomodoros.
  
	  I just got distracted during a pomodoro but caught me in time to still be able to pull something off this round (I think). The first five minutes I planned dinner with my partner (?), essentially forgetting I had set an intention to focus. Then I spent four minutes doing planning for the next few pomodoros, which is productive but not in the spirit of the thing. Now I'll actually do [[the thing]], which in this case is making [[free, fair and alive]] resolve well in [[agora server]].
- an [[algorithm]].
	- [[loop]]
		- [[rest]] think about what you want to do in the next pomodoro or the next few pomodoros, write it down.
			- [[announce]] it if you're doing announcements, but be wary of the risk of announcing: your brain might feel content with having announced and not move on to actually doing it :)
		- [[set a timer]] of the kind you want and reinforce your [[intention]].
			- make a [[commitment]].
			- then [[sit down]] or [[stand]] and [[do]].
			- ([[burn for greater good]])
- as of [[2022-06]] I've been doing more of them. they work, at runtime and for [[planning]].
- doing these on [[2022-08-20]], doing these most days honestly.

## [[2022-12-25]]

There are many [[pomodoro logs]], this is just one -- one of many even I keep :)
