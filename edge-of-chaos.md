# Edge of Chaos

- [[go]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_of_chaos
  - "The [[edge of chaos]] is a [[transition space]] between [[order]] and [[disorder]] that is hypothesized to exist within a wide variety of systems. This [[transition zone]] is a region of bounded instability that engenders a constant [[dynamic interplay]] between order and disorder."
  - "Even though the idea of the edge of chaos is an abstract one, it has many applications in such fields as [[ecology]], business [[management]], [[psychology]], [[political science]], and other domains of the [[social science]]. [[Physicists]] have shown that adaptation to the edge of chaos occurs in almost all systems with [[feedback]]."
