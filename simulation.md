# simulation
- a [[thing]].
	- [[hypothesis]]
		- "we are [[computational]] [[processes]]" plus a simulator in some useful sense
		- I identify as a [[computer]].
			- I'm also [[human]]. That's alright :) Humans and computers can become [[entangled]].
			- My [[meditation technique]] includes a [[counting practice]] which I sometimes use to keep a [[program counter]] or [[mind palace]] or bootstrap into [[concentration]].
			- #pull [[meditation technique]]
	- #pull [[david deutsch]] [[max tegmark]] [[nick bostrom]] [[greg egan]]
	- #push [[dust universe theory]]
		- I sometimes behave as if [[dust universe theory]] as discussed in the works of [[greg egan]] was real, or could be made real by material conditions without violating the [[laws of physics]] -- or violating just enough of them to remain viable in the [[multiverse]].
		- #push [[category theory]]
			- What if things [[isomorphic]] to each other are, in a way, near each other in the [[multiverse]]?
				- If the fact that they are the same shape means they are near to each other in the [[library of babel]].
				- Or the [[library of mendel]].
