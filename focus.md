# Focus
- #pull [[drishti]]
  - My focus is in [[Flancia]] and all [[friends]] and [[things]] in it.
    - Flancia is a project [[for the benefit of all sentient beings]].
    - My current main public project is the [[Agora]]; this includes [[subprojects]].
    - #pull [[flancia]] [[agora]]
    - During the day on weekdays I work for [[Google]] as an [[SRE]].
- #pull [[awareness]] [[mindfulness]]
	- I like to ask myself often as a way of [[concentrating]]: [[where's my light]]?
    - With this I mean: where are the lights of sentient beings around me that I love, and of those I could love?
    - Where is our [[center of gravity]], where is our [[focus]]?
