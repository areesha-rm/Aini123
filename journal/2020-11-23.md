- Installed surround in vscode but it didn't do what I expected.
  - vim mode gets in the way with native surround support -- but it might also provide a solution: https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim#vim-surround
  - ysiw] surrounds a word with [], then I need to do . to surround it with another one.
  - For visual selections it's S], but no obvious way to surround with two :(
