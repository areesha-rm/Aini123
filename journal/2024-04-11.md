takeaways/next steps

- great collaboration, even though colab is not the ideal collaboration platform :) passing code snippets and forking/merging does go a long way for prototypes!
  - let's optionally commit colabs to piper / make sure they are all linked in go/mlops-notes
  - opportunity to share corpora and cross-power up!
- opportunity to contribute to tools at Google
  - IRM 
  - llm4sre
    - they have 'serving' figured out, but their current use cases are still limited. in particular around large corpora
- share with team members
  - demo your tools, give access to them, gather feedback!
  - give tech talks -- one for ZRH is already scheduled ;)
