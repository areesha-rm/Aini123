- Meetings day a priori, but relatively few meetings today!
- #push [[do]]
  - I need to put my [[todo]] in order. I have by now a mix of [[wiki vim]] style and [[logseq]] style TODOs, and neither are aggregated.
  - Perhaps I should write a simple script or just [[egrep]] invocation that brings back all my undone items in different formats around my garden?

  - [[robert haisfield]] suggested we add 'path tracking' (not user identifiable) -- in the sense of knowing which paths each user took.
    - I'm thinking the nicest way to do this would be just [[query string]] based, e.g. each node linking to another node while appending itself to ?path=.
- I did [[yoga with x]] live today and then stayed on for 3h and nobody showed up :)
  - That's alright, maybe some did in the multiverse.
