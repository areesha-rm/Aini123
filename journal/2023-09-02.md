- Woke up by [[Bodensee]].
  - Will miss [[Flancia meet]] today as I temporarily don't have internet connectivity.
  - Will try to catch up later with people who were/are around! Apologies for missing it.
- [[Flancia meet]] topics as I expected them
  - [[docker]]
  - [[agora recipe]] is running on [[coop cloud]], which is nice (this is what is serving link.agor.ai) but it needs some improvements:
    - It should be easier to override Agora settings from the coop cloud recipe proper, e.g. Agora name and sources. This could take place in the form of mounting agora.yaml as a config file?
