  - started the day thinking about the [[revolution]] (thanks to the conversation with [[st]])
    - the term is entangled with violence through history -- it is a hard task, to [[disentangle]] it
      - very much like disentangling humanity from [[moloch]]!
    - will try to use [[reform]] and [[empowerment]] as alternatives wherever they suffice, but I think referring to the [[revolution]] by its name is still important in certain contexts
      - the [[revolution]] as I see it is defined by this Agora thanks to the commoning of people like [[neil]]
  - [[agora]]
    - [[agora doc]] is now the source of truth for [[agora pkg chapter]]
      - -> still planning to work on [[agora docs import]], but likely not today as the priority must be what I'm delivering tomorrow, and that's text (as if on a page) and diagrams
      - [[excalidraw]]
        - find the source for the one diagram I already made ([[agora architecture]]), hope I saved it somehow
