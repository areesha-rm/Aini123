- [[daniel c. dennett]]
	- #push [[darwin's dangerous idea]]
		- ...is overall great but [[chapter 13]] is a bit weird.
		- after reviewing diverse aspects of evolution in the previous chapters, for some reason [[dennett]] uses chapter 13 to pick a (lopsided, it seems to me) fight with a single author: [[stephen jay gould]].
		- this was less interesting than other chapters as it read a bit like a thorough demolition of a thesis that didn't seem to make a lot of sense to me in the first place. it felt a bit too much like a mid nineties science beef in the middle of a book about more extemporaneous truths.
