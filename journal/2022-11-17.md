  - talk with friend
    - our path to [[effective altruism]]
      - my path seems two fold:
        - [[rationality]] movement
        - [[buddhism]] / [[meditation]] 
      - merges in a [[protopian]] worldview
    - [[peter singer]]
      - [[the expanding circle]]
    - [[criticism]] of the movement
      - against longtermism
      - against meta / self serving aspects
      - against the discounting of human feelings
    - #push [[hedging]]
      - utilitarianism
        - [[earn to give]]
      - human condition
        - unique social and material opportunities
        - happiness
          - thriving
        - arts and culture
      - [[80000 hours]]
- that went well I think :)
- [[work]]
- [[crystal castles]]
  - I like [[kept]] although the whole way the band disintegrated makes me feel uneasy about listening to it
  - I should listen to [[alice glass]] solo more I think
- [[collect]]
- [ ] read the documentation as it was cleaned up by [[nathan]] and [[protean]]
- [ ] opt in writes in the [[federation]]
  - [ ] test
  - [ ] deploy
  - [ ] shift focus to [[agora api]] so that all bots can write through a unified interface
    - [[rest]] plus [[json]] or [[protobufs]]?
    - or [[activitypub]] ;)
