    - our path to [[effective altruism]]
      - my path seems two fold:
        - [[rationality]] movement
        - [[buddhism]] / [[meditation]] 
      - merges in a [[protopian]] worldview
    - [[peter singer]]
      - [[the expanding circle]]
    - [[criticism]] of the movement
      - against longtermism
      - against meta / self serving aspects
      - against the discounting of human feelings
    - hedging
      - utilitarianism
        - earn to give
      - human condition
        - unique social and material opportunities
        - happiness
          - thriving
        - arts and culture
