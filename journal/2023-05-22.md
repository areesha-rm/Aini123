  - I had an allergy attack yesterday but at some point it turned -- it stopped getting worse, started getting better. Was able to have a normal night after that.
  - Slept a solid 8h+ after that
  - Woke up feeling finally recovered from disease!

  - Starting the week energized.
  - It was a solid day!
  - Actually looking forward to the week.
