- #push [[Madrid 2022]].
  - I'll be in Madrid from today until [[2022-12-12]].

  - [[2022-12-08]]
    - was a fine day really.
  - [[2022-12-07]] <- a drishti
    - did focused work on [[agora chapter]] and that was nice. I hope it was enough?
    - also started writing [[monks in space]], which felt good as well. 
      - it also happened organically and then later when I checked my calendar-shaped todo it turns out I had planned this to happen (but forgot, at least on a conscious level.)
      - of course this is not super surprising as the number 7 is associated with monks, and the commons, in my [[mind palace]].
