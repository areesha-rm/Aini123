- My mom is leaving today. It was a great visit; I initially thought it would be too long (and told her so) but now she's going I know I'm going to miss her.
  - Having said that, I'm also looking forward to some time without family around -- I love my family but it's been seven months with family presence in the country and, although it was great, I'm not very used to it lasting this long as I've lived abroad for ten years. I expect I will feel reenergized as I go back to a more individual routine thanks to the change of pace that came with all the extra social/emotional interactions, though.
