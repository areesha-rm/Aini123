				- work on improving [[agora speed]], likely two approaches:
					- DONE move costly operations (like checking for [[pushes]]) to async/out of main rendering path (they become akin to client side pulls)

			- for how [[logseq]] stores them by default, which seems sensible
		- LATER in [[empty nodes]] wikipedia should be auto pulled by default?
