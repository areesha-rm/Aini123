				- work on improving [[agora speed]], likely two approaches:
					- NOW move costly operations (like checking for [[pushes]]) to async/out of main rendering path (they become akin to client side pulls)

		- LATER in [[empty nodes]] wikipedia should be auto pulled by default?
- #push [[later]]
	- write about [[mastodon]] (how to start using it, [[choosing a mastodon instance]]) and report back to [[mesh]].
