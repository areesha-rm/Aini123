- #push [[touchpad]]
  - [[Touchpad scrolling]] had been not working in [[paramita]] for like one week, it was one of those annoyances you can work around but end up spending a lot of time working around.

  - next time I might try [[libinput]]: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/426944/what-is-the-wayland-equivalent-of-xinput-list
