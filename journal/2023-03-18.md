- #push [[touchpad]]
  - Touchpad scrolling had been working in [[paramita]] for like one week, it was one of those annoyances you can work around but end up spending a lot of time working around.
  - https://askubuntu.com/questions/528293/is-there-a-way-to-restart-the-touchpad-driver fixed it for me -- good old `modprobe -r psmouse` then `modprobe psmouse` (!).
