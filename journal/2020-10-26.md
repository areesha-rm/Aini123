# 2020-10-26

- Monday.
- dist-upgraded my desktop. This is how you prevent dist-upgrade from asking you about every configuration file you've modified: ```apt-get --yes --force-yes -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-confdef" -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-confold" dist-upgrade```
- [[nts]] "[[Sounds of the dawn]], 22 jun 2018" is nice
- For some reason I didn't log [[gigafelon]] until today.
