- [[work]]
- [[social coop]]
  - [[twg]]
- [[flancia]]
  - [[agora chapter]]
    - try to do at least one pomodoro of editing *in suggestion mode*
      - already did this -- it was the first pomodoro of the night!
      - it felt nice to just do it. I had reasons to procrastinate (like emptying the dishwasher and loading it) but I somehow persevered.
  - #push [[yoga with x]]
    - bienvenidos!
      - el pueblo unido jamás será vencido!
        - [[flancia]] es la revolución de la gente buena, definida como la gente que quiere ser buena.
        - Flancia trata de ser opcional.
  - [[UI]]
    - better use of [[unicode]] :)
    - #push [[todo]]
      - [ ] [[executable subnodes]]
        - [ ] can totally work pretty much as is (in the branch) if we have an [[allowlist]]
      - add more effective [[default handler]] to agora server
              - [ ] it gives errors for /x/y for example, which I've been assuming works for a long while without actually having gone and made it work :)
          - #push [[agora chapter]] 
            - [ ] my next [[drishti]] -> [[2022-12-04]] is the [[deadline]] for the next iteration
            - [x] answer [[editors]]
              - write email
            - [x] start going through comments and incorporating learnings
            - note that UI improvements can yield more interesting screenshots
              - [ ] but at least one screenshot of an agora graph is long due
              - ;)
