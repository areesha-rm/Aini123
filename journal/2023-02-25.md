- [[flancia meet]]
  - nobody showed but I didn't announce it explicitly so I sort of expected that.
  - had a slow morning, started doing laundry earlier than usual; it felt nice :)
- [[projectm]]
  - installed [[projectm]] again on a lark yesterday in [[nostromo]], it goes very well with fractal mode.
    - I'm doing fractal mode (recursive screen) with [[wayland]] and [[wlvnc]] and it's very pleasant.
