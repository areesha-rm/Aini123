- [[flancia meet]]
  - nobody showed but I didn't announce it explicitly so I sort of expected that.
  - had a slow morning, started doing laundry earlier than usual; it felt nice :)
- [[projectm]]
  - installed [[projectm]] again on a lark yesterday in [[nostromo]], it goes very well with fractal mode.
    - I'm doing fractal mode (recursive screen) with [[wayland]] and [[wlvnc]] and it's very pleasant.
  - #push [[flatpak]]
    - I used [[flatpak]] to install [[projectm]] as it seemed like a fair use case after I didn't immediately find the frontend I was expecting in the Ubuntu packages. My main two pet peeves with Flatpak remain, one palliated.
- [[Flancia]]
  - going to [[Lausanne]] tonight for [[Greg]]'s birthday.
  - Will be jotting down thoughts in [[train to lausanne]].
  - [[Agora]]
    - I want to review the [[copyedit]] of [[Agora Chapter]] which I got back on Thursday.
      - Unsure how many pomodoros this will be, likely several?
        - [x] one
        - [ ] two
        - [ ] three
    - I want to code a bit.
      - Maybe install [[manim]] and something like it better geared towards doing large graph visualizations and start playing?
      - [x] Ended up reading about [[networkx]], [[igraph]], [[graph tool]] -- all interesting. [[networkx]] is all python, whereas the others are python libraries calling to a C++ implementation and scale better (at least this applies to [[graph tool]] IIRC.)
