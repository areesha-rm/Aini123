- [[flancia meet]]
  - nobody showed but I didn't announce it explicitly so I sort of expected that.
  - had a slow morning, started doing laundry earlier than usual; it felt nice :)
- [[projectm]]
  - installed [[projectm]] again on a lark yesterday in [[nostromo]], it goes very well with fractal mode.
    - I'm doing fractal mode (recursive screen) with [[wayland]] and [[wlvnc]] and it's very pleasant.
  - #push [[flatpak]]
    - I used [[flatpak]] to install [[projectm]] as it seemed like a fair use case after I didn't immediately find the frontend I was expecting in the Ubuntu packages. My main two pet peeves with Flatpak remain, one palliated:
    - It is frustrating to me you can search by name, e.g. `flatpak search projectm`, *and* install by name, e.g. `flatpak install projectm`, but *you can't run by short name*, that is, `flatpak run projectm` doesn't work.
    - This is made worse by the fact that `flatpak search projectm` may or may *not* show you the fully qualified name for the package; if your terminal is wide enough it will, but otherwise it will very unhelpfully take up a lot of the line to describe the package but mangle the fully qualifier identifier (what you need to pass to `flatpak run`) with an ellipsis.
    - I don't know of a good way to work around this currently. It seems like adding a `flatpak easyrun` command would be low hanging fruit? JUST RUN THE INSTALLED APP THAT MATCHES THE PASSED SEARCH TERM.
