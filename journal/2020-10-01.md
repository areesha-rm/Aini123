 - Installed Foam on my personal profile. I believe I'm done with Roam, and Obsidian is not good enough to justify using non-free software for my project.
 - Obsidian likely made importing notes into Foam easier, though, as its Markdown importer fixed up the raw Roam export.
 - I'm going to miss the super nice Obsidian graph.
 - I'm already loving the fact that I can use Vim keybidings in VSCode though :)
