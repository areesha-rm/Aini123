I'm going to try to start writing longer form in my journal entries; as of recently I've mostly done arbitrary-levelled item lists, which map nicely to trees, but I miss the expressivity of prose.

This week is critical at work; there are many decisions to be made for my project, and two review sessions scheduled. I'm finding the concreteness of what needs to happen this week helpful; I dislike deadlines but whenever they make sense I find them useful and can get behind them.
