- [[twitter]]
  - keeps mixing up my sessions so I made a mess of my [[profiles]].
- [[2022-10-01]]
  - [[october 2022]] begins, I'd like to plan it as such (as a month)
  - [[november 2022]] is the two year anniversary of the Agora (code wise), so I hope to be able to ship a package of noticeable improvements to anagora.org and maybe the agor.ai this month!

  - but today:
    - [[agora]]
      - [[agora bridge]]
        - I'd like to try moving [[agora twitter bot]] to [[tweepy 4]] which has [[twitter api v2]] support!
        - I'd like to read [[moa]] code to understand possible code reuse / convergence for the [[agora api]].
      - [[moa]]
        - ship one tiny improvement; maybe the mention of [[moa bridge]] in the homepage as suggested by a user in the [[moa channel]] (matrix).
