- [[testing]] [[pipe links]]
	- Poll if you're interested: for piped links (of the form `[[foo|bar]]`, which order looks most natural to you?
		- Option 1: `[[page name | an alias, perhaps in long form]]`
		- Option 2: `[[long form, perhaps matching the previous sentence | page name]]`
		- Option 3: `[[why don't we have both|por qu√© no los dos]]` :)
- #push [[logseq bugs]]
	- [[logseq]] sometimes 'snaps out' of my settings and goes back to writing pages in `pages/` and journals in the IMHO weird format `yyyy_MM_dd` and so on. Restarting seems to fix it?
	- [[another try]]
- now using [[foam]] in [[paramita]], [[logseq]] in [[nostromo]].
  - I intend to keep it that way for a while I think?
- worked quite a bit, but got some stuff done -- happy about it
 learnt about [[gnu stow]] for managing [[dotfiles]].
- [[agora]]
- I need to get back to some threads over social media:
  - [[stoa]]
  - question from [[codex]]
  - find that thread where someone was super kind and I just didn't answer them before losing the thread
    - was it on [[mastodon]] or [[twitter]]?
    - #push [[moa.party]]
      - it would be cool not to have to wonder, to have an independent archive for both
      - could also be [[agora bot]]
  - NOW continue doing something with [[matrix bot]]?
  - NOW ship [[pipe links]]
  - catch up with [[agora discuss]]! but how? :)
    - perhaps through the bot/grabbing logs otherwise?
