# 2021-01-26

- [[crowdcast]] session by [[erik kennedy]]: [[live redesign]]
  - recommended by [[bruno-winck]]
- [[vcalinus]] mentioned [[zettel]]
- [[push]] read [[know your amphetamines]] shared by [[abstractfairy]]
- [[synthesis]]
- [[push]] [[meditations]] [[procrastination]]
  - I usually get into a distracted and unproductive state when I don't notice what's on my mind; I have 'unflushed' context and I tend to ignore it.
  - Example from today: I felt like I needed to do something for a meeting a few hours later and I failed to actually realize it and do it. Result: a few hours of wasted productivity, and a rush fifteen minutes before the meeting to get it done.
- [[push]] [[agora feature requests]]
  - multiple pushes should work: see example above in [[2021-01-26]]
- [[agoras]]
