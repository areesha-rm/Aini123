- interesting discussion yesterday with [[kanopi]], [[bmann]], [[codex]] and [[james lu]] on tools for thought interchange.
  - [[kanopi]], [[bmann]] and [[codex]] are all about [[standoff properties]], which makes sense.
  - I feel there are two complementary approaches here: one [[markup]] based, one [[standoff]] based. They seemed to believe that standoff is clearly better, and they're into [[atjson]] in particular. It seems like a good approach and a good format to me, but I still feel markup has its place to shine and is complementary.
  - [[james lu]] seemed the most open to a 'why not both' approach.
