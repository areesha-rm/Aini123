- Did [[tax return]] with [[L.]]. She has superpowers; convinced me to do it first thing this weekend. Now we're done!
- [[project cat]] is going well, driven by [[L.]].
- Agora
  - [ ] Render my garden to /flancian instead of root.
  - Fix wiki:
    - [x] Fix CSS
    - [x] Lock it down to prevent more spammer signups, or perhaps reintroduce the lost captcha
    - [x] Clean up mess spammers did?
      - Left some of it, but removed most. Might or might not another pass later.
  - Render Agora, even if broken, to /v1/
  - Start Flask project to serve /v1/.
- Flancia
  - [ ] Add remnote.io to [[roam likes]]
  - [ ] Add logseq to [[roam likes]]
- Talked about [[effective altriusm]] with [[dbustac]].
- [[font-of-augurs]] introduced me to [[evanward97]], who seems interested in [[distributed-knowledge-graph]] and better information quality.
- Very interesting link by [[qiaochuyuan]] about [[fermi paradox]]: https://twitter.com/QiaochuYuan/status/1316194941530378241/photo/1
