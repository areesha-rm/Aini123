- Apparently there was some sort of controversy about a site called [[content nation]] in the Fediverse, and people from [[Mastodon]] came across as conservative/resistant to change/unfriendly to newcomers. I am not surprised.
- Good thing is I found [[wedistribute]] via the article linked in the node above, and I think I'm liking this site and maybe particularly a podcast they have called [[decentered]].
