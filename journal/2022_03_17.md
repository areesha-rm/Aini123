	- was a weird day in which I was initially off from work but ended up working, and being happy about it.
	- /shrug
		- should anagora.org get /shrug support? :)
- [[logseq]]
	- I should learn the absolute basics of querying, like a query to list/transclude all nodes that have NOW, LATER, TODO, DOING, DONE in them.

	- If [[logseq]] could stop forgetting my preferred date format for journals it would be really nice :) I sort of gave up on it for the last few weeks, and anagora.org/journals works with it now, but it still bothers me.
- #push [[free, fair and alive]]
	- doesn't have a [[wikipedia article]]... yet :)
- [[agora]]
	- [[agora server]] now properly removes [[logseq]]'s :LOGBOOK: metadata, apologies for the noise up to now.
- [[random thoughts]] (but perhaps not any more random than a randomly picked thought of mine :))
	- I am now at [[work]] without access to my main garden editor writing this on the basic Github editing UI. It... is not great, but it's also perfectly serviceable. Glad to have the option to edit this anywhere.
		- If Gitea could do editing better than this, perhaps that's a good enough reason to move my primary garden hosting there. Right now I'm only mirroring my Github garden repo to git.anagora.org. 
	- [[mood]] pensando en los ojos de [[lady burup]] al acecho.
		- bella manifestaci√≥n de su foco.
