- [[Work]] was alright -- I did what [[bobby lyte]] does and tried to do the day's worth of work in one hour, and it sort of worked believe it or not
- I posted about the [[magnetic projector]] I made to the [[Fediverse]] :)
- I had an amazing meeting with [[Eduardo Mercovich]] about the [[Fediverse]], the [[Web]], and [[Sutty]] and the [[Agora]] and [[Confluencia]].
- I [[flowed]] :)
