# 2021-02-26

- Testing my new laptop, a [[lenovo p14s]]
- Also testing [[neovim]] in [[vscode]] instead of just [[vim emulation]]. Seems to work quite well for now!

## [[doing]]
- [[work]]
- implement [[open search]] in the [[agora]].

## [[do]]
- get back to [[gerhard-zorn]]
- get back to [[will walker]]
- use flask.Config to separate dev/prod configs in the [[agora]] 
  - fix a lot of horrible hardcoding, like anagora.org/dev.anagora.org
