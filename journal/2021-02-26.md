- [[roam]]
- [[remora]]
- [[revolutions]]
- [[dungeons]]
- [[agora algorithm]]
- [[git alias]]

## [[done]]
- implement [[open search]] in the [[agora]].
- get back to [[gerhard-zorn]]
- get back to [[conaw]]

## [[doing]]
- [[work]]

## [[do]]
- get back to [[will walker]]
- use flask.Config to separate dev/prod configs in the [[agora]] 
  - fix a lot of horrible hardcoding, like anagora.org/dev.anagora.org
