- I met [[kris]] ~ [[kj]] yesterday [[2022-01-03]], it was great.
- Really enjoying [[Approaching the Buddhist Path]].
- [[work]]
  - Took the day off today to focus on [[Agora Chapter]] again, belatedly :)
- [[flancia]]
  - [[agora]]
    - [[agora chapter]]
      - Starting pomodoros at 14 after some "constructive procrastination".
      - Will be finishing up with laundry on breaks (lots of laundry in the last few days due to hosting people over the weekend).
- #push [[wayland]]
  - finally made VNC to a Wayland machine work! I just used [[wayvnc]]. I'm pretty sure it didn't work before but it does now; maybe before I was missing [[xdg portal]] or some variation? Or maybe I just upgraded some package in the meantime. 
  - In any case, this removes my final blocker to 'wayland anywhere' as far as I'm concerned, so I plan to move [[nostromo]] to Wayland over the next weekend or so.
