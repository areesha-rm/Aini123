- the [[stoa]] is auto pulled again by default -- in view mode, so it doesn't interfere with loading (steal focus) and also presents nicely in nodes like [[node club]].
- [[hedgedoc]] broke for a bit, thank you everyone for the bug reports!
- [[multiverse]]
- [[twitgreed]]
- [[robert axelrod]]
- [[flow]]
- [[249]]
- [[the mind illuminated]]

- [[matrix]]
  - [[xmpp]]
    - [[straw]] told me about [[dino]]
  - [[matterbridge]]
- [[knowledge graphs]]
- [[an invitation to applied category theory]]
- [[lemmy]]
- [[i am cuba]] 
  - [[es]] [[soy cuba]]
- [[do]]
  - make [[agora bot]] automatically respond to wikilinks by followers
    - https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1446533184380936192
  - have [[go]] default to [[wp]] if available
    - code [[auto wp]]? server side or client side?
    - it seems like [[go]] would require server side? but we could also have client side go. hmm.

I wonder if I should use [[ntlk]] a bit in the Agora -- currently it's all regexes, all the way down, but some lever of text understanding would go a long way w.r.t. surfacing actually related content.

I'm also wondering if I should do the Wikipedia integration client-side-first or with some support from [[agora server]]. Nice thing of keeping it wholly in the client is that it would keep the server-side rendering path lean (no network calls, only filesystem).
