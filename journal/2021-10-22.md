- the [[stoa]] is auto pulled again by default -- in view mode, so it doesn't interfere with loading (steal focus) and also presents nicely in nodes like [[node club]].
- [[hedgedoc]] broke for a bit, thank you everyone for the bug reports!
- [[multiverse]]
- [[twitgreed]]
- [[robert axelrod]]
- [[249]]
- [[do]]
  - make [[agora bot]] automatically respond to wikilinks by followers
    - https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1446533184380936192
  - have [[go]] default to [[wp]] if available
    - code [[auto wp]]? server side or client side?
    - it seems like [[go]] would require server side? but we could also have client side go. hmm.
