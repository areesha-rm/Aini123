  - #push [[kill wayland]]
    - #push [[autostart]]
      - Trying to set up [[vnc]] so it starts only after wayland/a graphical session is running and it's proving harder than expected for not the first time :)
      - I would expect to add a Requires or WantedBy in the systemd unit, but alas, it's not as easy as that. 
      - I use [[sway]] so maybe the right targets aren't there by default though, as that's supposed to be solved by a "[[desktop environment]]".
      - Somehow I ended up at https://github.com/jceb/dex which, beyonds its scope in a friendly way, tells me of how to configure a [[systemd autostart]] in a way that maybe will works.
