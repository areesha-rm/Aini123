- [[work]]
- [[Flancia]]
- [[wayland]]
  - [[autostart]]
  - [[systemd]]
  - #push [[kill wayland]]
    - Trying to set up [[vnc]] so it starts only after wayland/a graphical session is running and it's proving harder than expected for not the first time :)
    - I would expect to add a Requires or WantedBy in the systemd unit, but alas, it's not as easy as that.
