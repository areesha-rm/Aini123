  - Flancia is a container for [[My favourite things]]:
    - The common good
    - Happiness
    - Freedom from suffering
    - Science
    - Technology (inasmuch as it improves the world, which it does plenty)
    - Art
    - Knowledge
    - My friends and loved ones (inasmuch people are embodied as a composition of things)
      - Like [[Lady Burup]]
      - And you know who
    - The Agora (inasmuch it might show others the way to its [[entelechy]])
- [[Gone]]:
  - A [[poem]].
    - Gone
    - [[Gone beyond]]
    - [[Gone kindly]]
      - if you have to go,
      - go kindly!

I had noding "my favourite things" in a post-it so I decided to do it right here using a push above.
