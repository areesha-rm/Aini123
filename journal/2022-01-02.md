# 2022-01-02

- I hope to be able to [[hack]] a bit today. Yesterday I didn't get to it; interacting socially took a lot of the day. It was nice, though.
- I also would like to [[write]] a bit. My plan is to start by embedding flancia.org in the Agora (importing all posts from the core git repo), which may motivate me also to edit my old writing more (it's in sore need of editing and updating!).
- Topic du jour is whether it makes sense to persist with our plans to visit family and friends in February -- in particular because of the added risk to elderly family members because of [[covid]].
