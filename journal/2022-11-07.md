- delivered an iteration on [[agora chapter]] very early today to the editors :)
- [[work]]
  - meh

- This week looks tricky; I need to do my [[tax return]] by Friday (ideally by Thursday), and I can't really take a day off work as I have at least one crucial meeting to attend every day. Oh well. I'll do it in a half day?
