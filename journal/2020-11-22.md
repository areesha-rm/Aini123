# 2020-11-22

- Woke up late but happy. Today is [[oncall]] and [[Agora]] day.
  - [[Agora Plan]]
- Renamed [[piglia]] to [[Ricardo Piglia]]. I think [[foam]] is getting facilities for renaming?
- [[Luciana]] signed up for the Agora!
  - Feedback: having a dictionary in VSCode would be useful.
  - Solution: ctrl-p, copy/paste: ext install yzhang.dictionary-completion
  - Feedback: having to write a comment to commit is annoying ([[jonathan]] said the same).
  - Solution: set a default somehow? Need to look into this.
- Donated 120 CHF to [[UBI Zurich]].
- Asked [[jonathan]] about [[stephen wolfram]]:
  - [[stephen wolfram]] does not seem very involved with the math community in general.
  - Some people whose opinion he trusts have issues with his personality.
  - Mathematically he does not know much about what his current research is focused on.
- [[bodhisattva vow]].
- Set [[auto-commit messages]] in [[foam]] with https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39445199/how-to-make-visual-studio-code-remember-previous-commit-messages
- [[alan laidlaw]] introduced me to [[human computer interaction]].
- [[james baker]] has compatible goals.
