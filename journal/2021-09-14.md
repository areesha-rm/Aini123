# 2021-09-14

- I've been feeling so-so the past two days; tired and a bit down. I might be incubating something, or it could be part of a natural cycle.
- I'm oncall this week too, which doesn't help :) 
- I probably won't be able to dedicate as much time to the Agora as I would like this week; which has been the case as of late. It's a bit frustrating at times, knowing that there is so much I would like to do, and then not finding the time to do it. But it will also pass.
- When I do come back, [[agora bridge api]] is a priority. I'll try to at least set up the new virtual hosts and reverse proxying to the node api.
