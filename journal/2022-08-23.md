- [[agora]]
  - [[agora pkg chapter]]
    - I got to 6k words just before midnight and it felt great.
      - I need to write a lot more, then throw away half ("edit") -- but that's fine. I'm having fun :)
    - I keep a terminal with `watch "wc -w agora\ pkg\ chapter.md"` open and it's great. Up to 6125 now, when I'm calling it a night.
  - [[push]] and [[pull]] as intents
    - both #push and #pull take a [[node/heterarchy]] and I just remembered that
    - I mean, they don't currently ([[agora server]] doesn't have code for it) but I meant to make it happen.
    - [[go/foo/bar]], as in [[go/move/22]], is the only use of [[heterarchies]] currently.
- [[work]]
  - I think it'll be fun today, let's see if I'm wrong
