- Beautiful start to the day thanks to [[AG]]!
- Oncall, got paged at 9am -- not too early thankfully.
- Lady Burup is softer than ever it seems :)
- Thought about numbers and mindfulness.
  - Counted 89 mindful breaths using my [[binary mala]], my hands, while following to Sam Harris' daily meditation (10-11 minutes usually).
  - [[Magnetic mala]] probably should be 127 balls by default, as that's the first centered hex number which exceeds [[108]]. Incidentally is the amount of spare magnets I have after gifting a lot (gladly).
