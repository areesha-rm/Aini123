- Beautiful start to the day thanks to [[AG]]!
  - Oncall, got paged at 9am -- not too early thankfully. And I had left the bedroom so AG could sleep through it as I hoped.
  - [[Lady Burup]] is softer than ever it seems :) I have been thinking of maybe getting her a loyal feline companion, either Lord or Page, maybe short in years and happy to learn from her and assist? :)
- Thought about numbers and mindfulness.
  - Counted 89 mindful breaths using my [[binary mala]], my hands, while following to Sam Harris' daily meditation (10-11 minutes usually).
  - [[Magnetic mala]] probably should be 127 balls by default, as that's the first centered hex number which exceeds [[108]]. Incidentally is the amount of spare magnets I have after gifting a lot (gladly).
- Some [[social coop]] work, didn't find the root cause for the issue with indexing someone reported yet but made some progress.
- Thought of [[Richard Francis Burton]], the [[victorian scholar]].
  - [[Alejandro Dolina]] first told me about him.
- [[OEIS]] has a great page on [[offsets]] which make me think hex(1) should be 1, hex(2) should be 7 -- e.g. offset for [[hex numbers]] should be 1.
  - I'll fix hex.py in my bin/ in the garden accordingly ;)
  - This will let me assert: "the hexagon which is n long on any one side contains hex(n) magnets", e.g. hex(7) = 127.
