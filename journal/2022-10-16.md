- Had [[fondue]] last night with friends
- Earlier we had great coffee as well, [[l]] was around. I miss her!
- We then went to [[Basel]] with [[b]] and [[an]] today, it was beautiful.
  - [[bishopric of basel]]
    - has [[switzerland]]'s [[oldest university]]
  - Read [[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]] on the way there.
  - On the way back, going through comments to [[agora doc]] by the [[pkg book]] editors.
- [[ladee]]
  - Special weekend!
- [[agora]]
  - [[agora doc]]
    - great top level comment by [[ivo]]
  - [[agora development]]
    - [x] set up local dev environment in the train
      - [[poetry]]
    - better search?
      - what's a quantum of better search? it's pretty bad right now; e.g. [[poetry install]] would not bring up [[install poetry]]
        - would re-adding fuzzy matching fix this?
        - should I implement a simple search algorithm myself for the purpose of understanding how to solve this?
          - tokenization -> compute combinations is trivial but expensive
          - [ ] -> [[bag of words]] is cheap
