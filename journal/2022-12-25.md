- [[christmas day]] 
  - [[25]] ~ [[5]] [[5]]
  - woke up in Lausanne, visited [[Morges]] for a few hours with [[L.]] and it was very nice. A cold and damp day, but it was beautiful as we saw [[Lac Leman]] still and grey, looking almost metallic.
- [[flancia]]
  - [[agora]]
    - [[agora chat]]
    - [[agora chapter]]
      - today I must actually close a lot of comments :)
        - I plan to do [[eight pomodoros]] once I get home, more free form while I travel back home from [[Morges]].
          - [[8 pomodoros]]
          - Will keep a checkbox log in [[pomodoros]] -- I usually do it on paper but I'll try this today.
  - #push [[las jaras]]
    - tengo en mi [[carcaj]] dos jaras: [[Maitreya]] y el [[agora]].
        - I felt uneasy about identifying Maitreya with an object for a moment, but on closer inspection there was no need for repulsion: I would wish to be like an [[arrow]] for the benefit of all beings. 
  - #push [[agora dev]]
    - [ ] always pull wp
    - [ ] headers as in [[pomodoros]] or [[17]] pull/push
    - [ ] respond in social coop room
    - [ ] autopilot ~ always pull and maybe even scroll if the user isn't interacting with the viewport?
    - [ ] might be a nice prominent toggle for the long-in-the-making sidebar ;)
