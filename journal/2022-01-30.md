	- [[tienson qin]] said they'd consider changing the journal file name format to [[iso 8601]], happy about that :)
	- I'm missing alt-d a lot; [[g t]] is OK but you need to be out of edit mode for it to work. alt-d feels superior.
		- https://logseq.github.io/#/page/Custom%20keyboard%20shortcuts may be all that's needed, will take a look after starting with laundry :)
	- keeps forgetting my formatting rules from time to time, unsure why. I just had to correct the date format again /shruggie
	- installed plugins:
		- [[logseq-plugin-vim-shortcuts]]
			- IMHO needed -- I have [[vim keys]] deeply ingrained
		- [[logseq bullet threading]]
			- simple, looks nice, I like the effect -- see below (If these attachments work in the Agora, need to check)

	- [[fwfg]]
- took a walk, about 45' long. first one of the weekend! it was great -- we needed some time outside to detach from work/study (L.) and travel prep
- [[agora]]
	- LATER [[agora ext]] needs some convergence, there's three repos around including I believe a rewrite by [[@evan]] who didn't ship yet?
		- perhaps [[vera]] knows how to fix this though :)
	- [[agora bot]]
		- DONE [[agora matrix bot]] needs some bug fixes
