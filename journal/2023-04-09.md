  - #push [[Garland Sutra]] 
    - Wikipedia says the [[Buddhāvataṃsaka-nāma-mahā­vaipulya-sūtra]]is  "erroneusly often referred to as the [[Avataṃsaka Sūtra]]", but elsewhere the latter is referred to as a valid short name
  - c.f. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddh%C4%81vata%E1%B9%83saka_S%C5%ABtra and https://www.britannica.com/topic/Avatamsaka-sutra, maybe the rare case in which Wikipedia is more conservative than Brittanica?
  - Now I notice the first word of the longer title is literally [[Buddavatamsaka]], Garland of Buddhas, so I really don't see why it says erroneously :) Made an edit.
