- I had a nice walk yesterday with a friend.
	- We didn't, but we could have [[taken a walk on the wild side]].
- [[music]]
	- [[take a walk on the wild side]]
	- [[hunky dory]]
- [[writing]]
- [[build bridges]]
- #push [[philosophy in germany]]
	- [[1831-1933]]
- [[penguins]]
- [[google doc]]
- #push [[logseq]]
	- took like half a minute to load just now
	- unfortunately it still doesn't scale well enough, but I'm happy the team is responsive to performance issues!
	- I'm now using logseq while I code. I think I will benefit from using it when I want to focus on *one* thing. It doesn't do multi pane like [[wiki vim]], so I use that for running many tasks in parallel.
