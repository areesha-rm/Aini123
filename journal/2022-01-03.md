- [[do]]
  - [x] test/fix [[arbitrary pulls]]
  - [x] fix pulls for URLs in [[markdown links]] (e.g. wikipedia links that get pulled with a parentheses at the end)
  - [x] fix URLs with spaces/urlencoded so they behave at least as well as nodes with slugs
    - this was easier than expected -- as a hack, of course.
