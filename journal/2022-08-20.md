- This is the [[penultimate weekend]] of August 2022.
  - I'm oncall for [[Meet]].
  - My top priority for today beyond oncall interrupts (which can happen from 6am to 6pm) is to get [[agora pkg chapter]] into a readable state.
- [[flancia]]
  - [[flancia meet]]
  - [[agora]]
    - [[agora pkg chapter]] ~ [[agora chapter]]
      - top priority for the day
      - hmm, I already had [[agora doc]]
    - [[agora protocol]]
      - has been evolving thanks to the above and recent conversations :)
- [[writing while writing]]
