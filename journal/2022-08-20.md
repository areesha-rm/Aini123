- This is the [[penultimate weekend]] of August 2022.
  - I'm oncall for [[Meet]].
  - My top priority for today beyond oncall interrupts (which can happen from 6am to 6pm) is to get [[agora pkg chapter]] into a readable state.
- [[flancia]]
  - [[flancia meet]]
  - [[agora]]
    - [[agora pkg chapter]] ~ [[agora chapter]]
      - top priority for the day
      - hmm, I already had [[agora doc]]
    - #push [[agora protocol]]
      - â€¦has been evolving thanks to the above and recent conversations :)
      - The Agora is a protocol for [[building bridges]].
      - The Agora is a base contract and a set of [[agora rfcs]] extending [[agora protocol]] and defining optional contracts.
- [[writing while writing]]
  - [[public utility]] and [[public good]] all seemed predestined to have multiple meanings.
  - [[common good]] the same?
  - But all meanings are interesting *and* good? So perhaps it's not a problem.
- #push [[pomodoros]]
  - generalizing to organizing time rationally in 30 (25+5) minute blocks
  - a pomodoro counts as a pomodoro if you defined explicitly what you wanted to do, and then did it
  - yesterday [[fotl]] and the meeting with [[st]] were both 1. great and 2. something I had planned to do, so I counted them as five pomodoros (2.5h overall)
- #push [[meditation]]
  - [[metta]] is key to our [[practice]] ~ [[praxis]]
- [[consciousness explained]]
