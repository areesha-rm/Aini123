- [[push]] [[kazam]] 
  - A screencast [[tool]]; I've been meaning to record more screencasts about the [[agora]], show it in action.
  - Seems easy enough to use, I've been using it for [[yoga with x]] as well and ocassionally to record conversations that I have over [[meet]] (which unfortunately no longer supports recording in the [[dasher]] tier I'm in).
