- [[datd]]
- [[push]] [[kazam]] 
  - A screencast [[tool]]; I've been meaning to record more screencasts about the [[agora]], show it in action.
  - Seems easy enough to use, I've been using it for [[yoga with x]] as well and ocassionally to record conversations that I have over [[meet]] (which unfortunately no longer supports recording in the [[dasher]] tier I'm in).
- [[push]] [[do]]
  - [[wp]] link up top in the agora should be pullable
  - try moving the stoa to the same section? as it's technically out-of-agora (doc.anagora.org just happens to be run by [[flancia collective]] as well, but it's only one of infinitely many stoas).
- [[game]]
- I [[worked]] five hours today.
  - willingly!
