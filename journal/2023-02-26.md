- On the train back from [[Lausanne]] after midnight.
  - Very nice party!
  - [[Agora]]
    - I want to review the [[copyedit]] of [[Agora Chapter]] which I got back on Thursday.
      - Unsure how many pomodoros this will be, likely several?
        - [x] one
        - [ ] two
        - [ ] three
    - I want to code a bit.
      - Maybe install [[manim]] and something like it better geared towards doing large graph visualizations and start playing?
      - [x] Ended up reading about [[networkx]], [[igraph]], [[graph tool]] -- all interesting. [[networkx]] is all python, whereas the others are python libraries calling to a C++ implementation and scale better (at least this applies to [[graph tool]] IIRC.)
