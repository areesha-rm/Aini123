# uplifting

- I don't think I've written about this before, but I'm really into thinking about [[uplifting]]. That is, the process in which all conscious beings could be [[uplifted]] to a place of great [[thriving]] according to their [[true nature]], however that can be defined and upheld.
  - I would [[uplift]] [[cats and dogs]], [[pigs]], most animals really -- if we had the [[technology]].
  - I would [[uplift]] [[plants]] and [[trees]].
