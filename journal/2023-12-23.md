- [[Flancia]]!
  - [[Flancia meet]]
    - quiet in the morning, used it for planning :)
    - [[agora development]]
      - [ ] I want to continue in the vein of [[december adventure]], with small improvements and some new experimental features.
        - This will continue through the whole weekend ;)
    - [[fediverse]]
      - [x] Yesterday I tried one bridge between [[Bluesky]] and the [[Fediverse]] and it failed, but I want to try again :)
        - it failed again: bluesky.bovine.social. It looks promising though, I opened an issue in the Codeberg repo and took the chance to set up my [[Codeberg]] profile at last.
        - I also gave https://brid.gy a try and it was able to log into my Mastodon and Bluesky both, but it seems designed to cross-post between those and [[webmentions]] only/first.
          - [ ] This made me think that I should really implement webmentions in the Agora?
    - I also want to take some time to see friends IRL :)
      - Happy about this!
