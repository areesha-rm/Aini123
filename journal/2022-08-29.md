- [[2022-08-28]] was productive but it ended with some deflation as I realized just how much there is still to do on [[agora pkg chapter]] and [[go/agora doc]] :)
  - sync is not solved, did the sync to [[agora doc]] by hand just now -- it keeps links but footnotes aren't really in the doc, there's some formatting issues.
  - there is just a lot to be edited/written yet.
  - there's duplication.
  - I need to be able to read end-to-end and not think "this section is completely crap/redundant" more than, say, once -- *this evening* ideally :)
- [[29]]
  - [[drishti]]
  - think of my [[focus]], stay on target :)
