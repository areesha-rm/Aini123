- In the [[Flancia pattern language]], [[10]] stands for:
  - [[2]] * [[5]], meaning for example [[fork your focus]]
  - [[right view]] (10 .. 17 hold the eightfold path)
  - [[may you be free from suffering]] (as it comes after [[9]])
- [[Agora development]]
  - Yesterday I pushed to anagora.org ("prod") after merging a few PRs, it was great.
  - Apparently this broke topline search (redirecting to searching at e.g. Google), will now look into why and
    - [x] fix it
- #push [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]
  - [[The Language of the Night]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Language_of_the_Night
- [[trip to X]]
- [[magnetic]] [[3d printing]]
  - -> [[magnetic 4d printing]]
- [[agora slides 2023]] :)
  - enjoyed the process!
  - I've wanted to add a 'WTF' button to the Agora of Flancia for some time, I think I may go ahead and base it around this node ;)
  - thought of [[4k.agor.ai]], an Agora that could default to the dimensions in a full screen 4k monitor.
    - embedding 2x2 iframes would result in the approximate 4-browser-tiles format that seems like a solid default for such a resolution.
    - more generally of course this should be implemented as a reactive layout where display resolution (default) and users specify the tiling shape.
