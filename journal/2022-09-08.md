- Started my journal at 15:23 PM, which is unfashionably late (?) back home, but makes sense because of the break with routine that came with the holidays. I did [[meditate]] just before midday though, which was great. And petted [[Lady Burup]] a lot.
  - Now in a coffee place about to do a [[pomodoro]].
