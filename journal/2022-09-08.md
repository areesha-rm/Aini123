- Started my journal at 15:23 PM, which is unfashionably late (?) back home, but makes sense because of the break with routine that came with the holidays. I did [[meditate]] just before midday though, which was great. And petted [[Lady Burup]] a lot.
  - Now in a coffee place called just "coffee", not to be confused with [[just coffee]] also in ZÃ¼rich elsewhere, about to do a [[pomodoro]] for the [[commons]].
    - Forked into two tasks, then forked again.
      - [x] setup / planning
      - [x] comments/threads about [[revolution]], [[agora of flancia]]
    - [[agora instances]]
