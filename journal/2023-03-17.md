- Lady Burup threw a [[d24]] three times and got 7, 23, 15 -- which in my numeric [[memory palace]] mean:
  - [[7]]: [[Avalokiteshvara]] and [[Compassion]]
  - [[23]]: [[Lady Burup]] herself
  - [[15]]: [[Right Effort]] and [[3]]*[[5]]
- I'd call throwing dice with Lady Burup and seeing what comes up (well meaning) [[Chaos Magic]] :).
- [[Work]]
  - Low energy and I didn't finish my CL, I may choose to catch up over the weekend.
  - But then again I'm low energy because they laid off three of my favorite people in my workgroup, so maybe I've been doing emotional work close to full time.
