- [[17]] is [[Maitreya]] and [[Right Concentration]].
- Lady Burup threw a [[d24]] three times and got 7, 23, 15 -- which in my numeric [[memory palace]] mean:
  - [[7]]: [[Avalokiteshvara]] and [[Compassion]]
  - [[23]]: [[Lady Burup]] herself
  - [[15]]: [[Right Effort]] and [[3]]*[[5]]
- I'd call throwing dice with Lady Burup and seeing what comes up (well meaning) [[Chaos Magic]] :).
- [[Work]]
  - Low energy and I didn't finish my CL, I may choose to catch up over the weekend.
  - But then again I'm low energy because they laid off three of my favorite people in my workgroup, so maybe I've been doing emotional work close to full time.
  - I spoke at the [[walkout]] on Wednesday and I'm happy I did.
- [[Flancia]]
  - A bit of a chaotic night after work (as you can see by my playing with dice with Lady Burup :)) but I advanced some threads.
  - I ended up shuffling some books which made me think I have many -- which is true, both in the sense of having them in my library I am [[privileged]], I posted about this today) and having *a lot* of books in 'started' state. I now have books in this state in essentially every room of the house. I probably need to turn the well meaning chaos into some more order, or channel the chaos into something constructive :)
