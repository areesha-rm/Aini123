- Lady Burup threw a [[d24]] three times and got 7, 23, 15 -- which in my numeric [[memory palace]] mean:
  - [[7]]: [[Avalokiteshvara]] and [[Compassion]]
  - [[23]]: [[Lady Burup]] herself
  - [[15]]: [[Right Effort]] and [[3]]*[[5]]
  - I'd call throwing dice with Lady Burup and seeing what comes up (well meaning) [[Chaos Magic]] :).
