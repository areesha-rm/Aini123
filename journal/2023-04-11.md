- [[2023-04-10]] came and went with a variety of feelings
- [[work]]
  - oncall, got paged before 8am, but it was nothing critical and I was able to fall back asleep eventually (I needed some more rest)
  - [[focus]] time is important, I'll try to do 2h of focus before meetings today -- I usually find it hard due to the [[dead time]] phenomenon, but I also think I want to try to become better at focusing even in such a situation (when there are imminent appointments)
