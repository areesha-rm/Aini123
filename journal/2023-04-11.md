- [[2023-04-10]] came and went with a variety of feelings
  - [[10]] stands for:
    - [[right view]]
    - 2*5 == fork your focus
    - [[om tare tuttare ture soha]] (10 syllables)
- [[work]]
  - oncall, got paged before 8am, but it was nothing critical and I was able to fall back asleep eventually (I needed some more rest)
  - [[focus]] time is important, I'll try to do 2h of focus before meetings today -- I usually find it hard due to the [[dead time]] phenomenon, but I also think I want to try to become better at focusing even in such a situation (when there are imminent appointments)
  - [[summit]] prep
    - [ ] publish document for session
    - [ ] review sessions
    - [ ] verify status of canadian permit as I'm doing a layover there
    - [ ] book hotel in sunnyvale
- [[aj]]
  - happy we met!
