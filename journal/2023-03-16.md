  - I threw the d60 three times and I got:
    - [[13]] [[right conduct]]
    - [[16]] [[right mindfulness]]
    - [[21]] [[building bridges]], or [[merge our compassion]]

- My new credit card (the other one was disabled due to fraud; someone apparently managed to buy three gift cards in itunes with the previous one) arrived today and it was funny+sad how having it made me feel a re-upgrade as a citizen of a privileged country in late stage capitalism.
