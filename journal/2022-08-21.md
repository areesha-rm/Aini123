    - [[agora pkg chapter]] (remains the source of truth for now)
      - [x] [[edit]]
      - [ ] write
        - add topics to add to the agora protocol section up top
        - expand some [[agora protocol]] sections
      - [ ] code
        - set up sync to google docs (simple)
          - hmm, [[pandoc]] doesn't do [[wikilinks]] out of the box
          - might be easier to add a /convert/ endpoint to the agora? the html it produces can be copy/pasted to relatively good effect into a [[google doc]], I've done it by hand for [[agora doc]] and it looks fine
        - agora protocol sections could be elided my pandoc by default?
          - or formatted in a special way?
          - but see above about maybe having [[agora server]] do this so as not to duplicate functionality?
        - -> can assume if it uses indented lists *and* [[wikilinks]], it is Agora protocol
          - the Agora can naturally do that and include that assumption in the output?

    - [[alternating layouts]] doesn't work for [[sway]] it seems, no surprise

- -> back to #push [[agora pkg chapter]], now writing
  - [ ] target for the day is 5k words
  - [ ] maximum for the submission is 10k words, maybe shoot for 8k by [[wednesday]]?
    - follow the principle of 1k a day, only expanding ideas that are currently in [[agora protocol]] somewhere in the node already; do not add more ideas until those are fleshed out (unless something truly huge is missing somehow?)
  - [ ] make Meta a proper printable section for fun: maybe detail how the document exemplifies Agora Protocol, and how Agora Protocol was influenced by:
    - writing the outline
    - the process of converting
