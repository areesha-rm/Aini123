    - [[agora pkg chapter]] (remains the source of truth for now)
      - [ ] [[edit]]
      - [ ] write
        - add topics to add to the agora protocol section up top
        - expand some [[agora protocol]] sections
      - [ ] code
        - set up sync to google docs (simple)
          - hmm, [[pandoc]] doesn't do [[wikilinks]] out of the box
          - might be easier to add a /convert/ endpoint to the agora? the html it produces can be copy/pasted to relatively good effect into a [[google doc]], I've done it by hand for [[agora doc]] and it looks fine
        - agora protocol sections could be elided my pandoc by default?
          - or formatted in a special way?
        - -> can assume if it uses indented lists *and* [[wikilinks]], it is Agora protocol
