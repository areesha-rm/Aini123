- Note [[Silverbullet]] is currently journaling at a different path, the Agora should show both in any date-matching nodes.
- [[agora development]]:
  - [ ] pull silverbullet editor somewhere in the Agora
    - [ ] host silverbullet for people with a docker container + associated git repo (maybe automatically created at git.anagora.org?)
    - [ ] write about social hosting :)
  - #pull [[index]] from now-index!
- [[agora discuss]]:
  - write about idea of [[7 ceos]] (e.g. for [[tech corporations]]), [[7 presidents]] (e.g for [[Russia]]).
- [x] write about the nature of existence :)
- [x] [[edit]]
- [[agora development]]:
  - [ ] implement URL pulls, it's been on the todo for quite long! :)
    - this would make [[edit]] work (at least for me, for now) :)
    - this seems to almost work :)
  - [ ] look into the bugs that neil reported
    - finding them in [[agora discuss]] led to enjoying that space as usual! :D
- [[what if we became better protopians]]?
