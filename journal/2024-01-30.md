  - Free day from [[work]] -- back tomorrow :) I did two little things only that took 30 minutes async.
    - took a quick walk and made a quick dash to the supermarket
    - [[bettwanzen]] project continues :)
    - more [[laundry]] while listening to the [[audiobooks]]
    - cleaned the kitchen surfaces including cabinets -- long in the making!
  - [[agora development]]
    - fixed [[turtle]] :)
      - In two ways. Two degrees of brokenness came up while browsing and I decided to just fix it :)
      - It felt great!
  - Got to [[four seals]] again when I picked up [[The Foundation of Buddhist Practice]], and also to [[Madyamaka]] for the first time.
    - This happened because the way of the [[Bodhisattva]] is at [[AG]]'s place. Also looking forward to continuing that.
    - I want to read more about [[Nagarjuna]].
- I listened to [[David Whyte]] and an interesting snippet on [[Future Discounting]] in [[Waking Up]]. Thanks [[Sam Harris]] as usual!
