- Tried [[tab groups]] in vscode to handle my tab sprawl in [[foam]] and it nuked my tabs. Hit a weird bug in which it kept cycling through tabs uselessly too. Another day, another bug.
  - At laeast my [[foam]] is working a bit faster again after getting rid of hundreds of editors. Then again, [[wikilinki]] completion is still slow -- and I "only" have ~10k nodes so far. I fear [[foam]] will become unusable for me in a few more months unless I actively seek a fix.
