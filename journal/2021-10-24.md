- Tried [[tab groups]] in vscode to handle my tab sprawl in [[foam]] and it nuked my tabs. Hit a weird bug in which it kept cycling through tabs uselessly too. Another day, another bug.
  - At laeast my [[foam]] is working a bit faster again after getting rid of hundreds of editors. Then again, [[wikilinki]] completion is still slow -- and I "only" have ~10k nodes so far. I fear [[foam]] will become unusable for me in a few more months unless I actively seek a fix.
- Yesterday I spent a lot of time in developing the [[exec]] pattern in Agora server. With the light of another day, I wonder if I should have gone for a full client-side implementation instead for the simple things I had in mind: automatic [[wp]] subnodes pointing to the most relevant Wikipedia page for each node (when one is found through the Wikipedia API). But I still think the server-side [[exec]] pattern might come in handy, so I'll probably finish piping it through and enable a simple example.
- Today I'd like to:
  - [[write]]
  - [[code]]
    - continuing with the client side of [[exec]]
  - talk to [[family]] and [[friends]] over video chat
- I also need to pack for the [[offsite]].
