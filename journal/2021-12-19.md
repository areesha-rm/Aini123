- [[agora bot]] is living a schizophrenic life. It behaves differently in [[twitter]] and [[mastodon]] in a way that generates friction. I find it hard to keep track of it.
  - So first I'll try to document it in the [[agora]].
  - And then I'll try to refactor them, make them share more code, so that they can converge on the same default behaviours.
  - Then I'll try to make their behaviours fully [[user programmable]].
