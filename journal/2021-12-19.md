  - [[push]] [[agora bot]] is living a schizophrenic life. It behaves differently on [[twitter]] and [[mastodon]] in a way that generates friction. I find it hard to keep track of their behaviours.
    - So first I'll try to document behaviours in the [[agora]].
    - And then I'll try to refactor them, make them share more code, so that they can converge on the same default behaviours.
    - Then I'll try to make their behaviours fully [[user programmable]].
    - As for [[agora bot]], for the [[agora]].
    - As for the [[agora]], for the [[world]] that wants it.
