- Need to figure out a good workflow for [[quick capture]] with [[gitjournal]].
  - [[weekend]] served as quick capture this morning, but the lack of wikilinks in [[gitjournal]] makes it hard to both create a new note for a purpose and link it.
  - Perhaps I should have an [[inbox]] node, or a [[quick capture]] node, and mostly edit that in mobile.
- Band name: [[I'll kill your shining lights]].
