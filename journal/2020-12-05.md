- Need to figure out a good workflow for [[quick capture]] with [[gitjournal]].
  - [[weekend]] served as quick capture this morning, but the lack of wikilinks in [[gitjournal]] makes it hard to both create a new note for a purpose and link it.
  - Perhaps I should have an [[inbox]] node, or a [[quick capture]] node, and mostly edit that in mobile.

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[quick-capture]: ../quick-capture "Quick Capture"
[gitjournal]: ../gitjournal "Gitjournal"
[weekend]: Weekend "Weekend"
[inbox]: ../inbox "Inbox"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
