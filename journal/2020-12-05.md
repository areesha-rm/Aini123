# 2020-12-05

- Need to figure out a good workflow for [[quick capture]] with [[gitjournal]].
  - [[weekend]] served as quick capture this morning, but the lack of wikilinks in [[gitjournal]] makes it hard to both create a new note for a purpose and link it.
  - Perhaps I should have an [[inbox]] node, or a [[quick capture]] node, and mostly edit that in mobile.
- Band name: [[I'll kill your shining lights]].
- [[telegram]] [[armengolaltayo]].
- [[meet]] [[samuel-klein]]
  - [[wikilinks everywhere]]
- noded [[rainbow folding]]
- [ ] Comprar silla
- [ ] Agora help: how to create a note in Foam, shortcuts.
- [ ] Agora howto: update clients and procedure for making foam work with a github repo
