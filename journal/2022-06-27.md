- I travel back this evening, although because of a relatively long layover in London (5.5h) and the time difference I'll get to [[ZÃ¼rich]] tomorrow night (after 8PM).
  - We had lunch with [[wil]] in the office and we talked about math and science fiction, it was great.
- [[travel]]
  - [x] check in
  - [x] pack
  - [x] do covid paperwork with the crappy app or just assume the risk of doing it in the airport
  - [x] pick up the sunscreen shipment from amazon lockers.

I am writing this in the flight from Portland to London.

After my [[dreams]], and the [[poem]], and what happened this weekend, I keep thinking about [[arrows]]. It may sound like an obsession but it feels more like [[inspiration]].

- [[ladee]]
  - [[ladcia]]
    - [[cicadas]]
- #push [[meditations]]
  - even as we [[fork]], we'll [[merge]]
- #push [[heresies]]
  - [[god]] exists and [[buddhas]] are some of their prophets
