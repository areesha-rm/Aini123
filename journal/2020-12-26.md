- Asked [[twitter]] about a [[digital garden configuration]] [[standard]].
- [[paleoludic]] told me about [[the cloud of unknowing]].
- [[nbhdlady]] told me about [[capsule wardrobe]].
- Ran into the [[open graph protocol]].
- [[rdf]] [[turtle]]
- [[go]] [[mid career greatest hits]]
- [[mid career greatest hits]]
