- worked today for as long as I planned to, then did one pomodoro on the [[agora]]. it felt good.
- [[the witcher]] season 2
  - thought about [[magic]]
    - thought of one possible (fictional) explanation for why magic could have worked, then gone away from the world.
- [[vera]] coded [[hover]] behaviour for the [[agora]], gave it a try, feeling nice
- [[push]] [[meditation technique]]
  - [[box breathing]]
  - count up one after a full inhale+exhale cycle
  - optionally factorize number or run f(n) on the exhale, this seems to help retention/focus
  - primes feel like rest in a nice way
  - optionally attach thoughts / projects / items to numbers
  - numbers 1..7 are currently attached
- [[push]] [[knowledge commons]]
  - [[neil]] called out that [[commoning]] is as important as the [[commons]], should include this
  - [[commoning]] as the solution to coordination problems?
