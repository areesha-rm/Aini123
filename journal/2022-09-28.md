- Started [[noding]] surprisingly late!
  - I was doing focused work on the Agora, but somehow not using the Agora to document it :)
  - Unless you consider the [[agora bridge]] repository part of the Agora, that is ;) Which maybe we should.
- Saw [[m d]], it was great.
- I didn't see [[j]] in the end but I think we'll see each other soon.
- [[agora bridge]]
  - [[agora bot]]
    - [[agora twitter bot]]
      - Fixed mentions.
      - #push [[opt in writes]]
        - I did some pomodoros on this and got to an improved state. Now the bot works with mentions at least, and after opting in it writes :)
        - Thinking of making #push / [[push]] a trigger for [[opt in]] as well.
  - [[presentation]]
