  - I am still feeling a bit wiped from the [[allergy attack]] yesterday, but I will probably work at least for half a day
- Really enjoying [[Approaching the Buddhist Path]] by the [[Dalai Lama]] and [[Thubten Chodron]].
  - On [[Afflictions]]: they include what we would call negative emotions, but also destructive/non-constructive views.
  - Chapter 3 got into the cultural and linguistic gaps between Tibetan, Sanskrit and English.
  - On [[positive attachments]]:
    - a baby to their mother
