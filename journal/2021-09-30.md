- Woke up early today, as Luciana had an early class. I enjoy the peace and quiet in the early (for me anyway) morning -- at least once in a while.
- I'd love to have a way to pull in the [[agora]] context from within [[foam]]. I wonder how hard it would be to start an [[agora]] extension that pulls a web view with the right Agora page for each note. Probably not very hard, but it feels a bit under-stimulating how the same work would need to be done for every client -- or at least also for [[obsidian]] and [[logseq]]. 

(eight hours pass)

- Just got out of work -- it was a sleepy day, not super productive but getting at least some things done.
