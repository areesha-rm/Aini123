- trying out [[wlvncc]], which I will try to remember as [[WayLand VNC Client]], also for machine-to-machine connections -- so far I was only using it for [[portal]], the script that I use to have a recursive view into a computer I'm using.
  - it works very well but it doesn't have 'raw keyboard mode', which I need to be able to forward [[sway]] events to the target host that is also running sway.
