- [[Flancia]]!
  - Monday free to spend with friends; [[mpd]] left at 1pm, then we walked through ZÃ¼rich with [[BA]] and met [[AG]] and [[VK]] through the day.
  - Tomorrow back to [[work]] in earnest.
  - [[7]] makes me think of the [[Agora of Flancia]] and [[Avalokiteshvara]] as both are associated with it in the [[Flancia Pattern Language]].
