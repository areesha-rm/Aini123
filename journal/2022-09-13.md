- [[vacation]]
  - as I'm on holiday, I'm taking some time to try to update [[paramita]] to [[wayland]] :D
  - this will be my second computer on wayland, after [[sila]] (a work laptop).
  - installed:
    - [[sway]]
    - [[kanshi]]
    - [[kitty]]
    - [[grimshot]]
    - [[swaylock]]
    - [[wofi]]

I sometimes [[procrastinate]] on important things, does that make me a [[jerk]]? I think maybe it does, and I should [[curb my bullshit]].
