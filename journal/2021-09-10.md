- I'm back!
  - Or so I keep saying. This would be worrying if this were a blog -- you might know the drill. You find a blog, not updated for years, and the two last posts boil down "I'm going to try to write here more often".
  - I'm not worried because this is not a blog, it's the [[agora]].
  - And also because the weekend is coming :)
