- I think this weekend I'm moving back to [[foam]] from Obsidian. I had issues with Foam, but I like it still, and Obsidian has its own set of issues *and* isn't open source.
  - One thing that Foam does really well is reuse [[vscode]] for its strength.
  - I will try to keep the filename convention that I set up for Obsidian: instead of slugs, filenames are [[full unicode]].
  - [[foo bar]]
