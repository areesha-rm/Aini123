- I think this weekend I'm moving back to [[foam]] from Obsidian. I had issues with Foam, but I like it still, and Obsidian has its own set of issues *and* isn't open source.
  - One thing that Foam does really well is reuse [[vscode]] for its strength.
  - I will try to keep the filename convention that I set up for Obsidian: instead of slugs, filenames are [[full unicode]].
  - [[push]] [[do]]
    - [[fix foam]]
      - disable [[slugs]]
      - always create notes on root by default
        - figure out whether to keep journal/
          - what does [[logseq]] use?
- [[agora bot]]
- [[hall of mirrors]]
- I need social media integration so bad, I want to get it done this weekend no matter what. I think this one I can make the time!
- [[kibble]]
- [[visual cortex]]
  - [[blind people]]
