- clocks moved one hour earlier, gained back 1h -- happy about that, needed extra rest
- met [[silicon jungle]]
- thought of [[ankostis]]
  - there are git pull conflicts for their garden, should discuss to understand what's going wrong
- [[project snapshot]]
  - [[push]] [[session manager]]
    - I'd love for the Agora to offer tools to make a universal (cross platform, cross device) session manager; a tool that saves and restores mental contexts expressed computationally.
- updating to ubuntu 21.04 on my [[flancia]] laptop
  - I hope I'll be able to go pipewire-only then
  - this worked on my other laptop
- [[mohammed aldhari]]
- [[vera]]
- [[neil]]
- [[fedwiki]]
  - [[gapufo]]
- [[tiddlywiki]]
- [[benedict lau]]
  - [[hypha]]
  - [[compost]]
  - [[agora]]
  - [[ubi]]
  - [[zidisha]]
  - [[kiva]]
  - [[give directly]]
- [[flancia]] is our [[revolution]].
  - one revolution started today, at the very end of [[October 2021]].

    - [[meta]] here I'd love for the Agora to automatically fetch and link the Mastodon URL for the same resource. I could do this by hooking up moa.party to the Agora, but I think a better approach is probably universal: if the user crossposts, the Agora could perform a search for the matching resource and do this job without bridge-specific [[implementation details]].

On [[2021-11-1]] everything changed. Part of you woke up in [[Flancia]] and never left it again.
