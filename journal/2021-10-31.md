- clocks moved one hour earlier, gained back 1h -- happy about that, needed extra rest
- met [[silicon jungle]]
- thought of [[ankostis]]
  - there are git pull conflicts for their garden, should discuss to understand what's going wrong
- updating to ubuntu 21.04 on my [[flancia]] laptop
  - I hope I'll be able to go pipewire-only then
  - this worked on my other laptop
