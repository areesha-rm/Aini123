- [[30]]
  - Thinking about the transition from October to November and the transition from Julian to Gregorian calendar affecting dates related to the [[Russian Revolution]] of October/November 1917.
  - This also caused by my recently having started to read [[China Mieville]]'s book on the revolution :)
- [[agora]]
  - [[agora chapter]] deadline today, let's see how far I get! today I hope to start early and finish late.
    - General [[patterns]] identified by the editors
      - #G1 too many links / links which aren't explicitly wikilinks
        - Strategy: cut links by 50%, add back [[wikilink markers]] for all remaining links (makes me "pay for them" in a way)
      - #G2 should address the reader of the book more than the user of an Agora
      - #G3 lacking information on similar initiatives/prior work
      - #G4 should be less of a manifesto and more a concrete description of the system that integrates PKGs
      - #G5 lacks cohesion, add transitional paragraphs
      - #G6 repetition
      - #G7 Agora discussed as having agency (might be OK, but might also be confusing)
      - #G8 use of bullet points which should be written as long form text
- #push [[flancia]]
  - [[flancian]]
    - [[yoga with x]]
