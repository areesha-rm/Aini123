- #push [[agora chapter]]
  - [[patterns]] identified by the editors
    - #G1 too many links / links which aren't explicitly wikilinks
      - Strategy: cut links by 50%, add back [[wikilink markers]] for all remaining links (makes me "pay for them" in a way)
    - #G2 should address the reader of the book more than the user of an Agora
    - #G3 lacking information on similar initiatives/prior work
    - #G4 should be less of a manifesto and more a concrete description of the system that integrates PKGs
    - #G5 lacks cohesion, add transitional paragraphs
    - #G6
    - #G7
    - #G8
