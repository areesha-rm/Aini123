- I love [[Portland]].
  - I met [[todd]], it was a very significant moment.
  - I met [[wil]], we went on a beautiful walk in the [[japanese garden]].
  - I met [[john]], [[mary]], [[matthew]].
  - I was only able to spend fifteen minutes in [[powell's books]] but I loved every minute of it and it was enough to know it's amazing.
