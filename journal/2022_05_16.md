- Sunday didn't go according to plan w.r.t. [[pomodoros]] and such, but I am OK with how it turned up anyway.
	- Did [[laundry]].
	- Had coffee with our [[neighbors]].
	- Met my [[brother]] and we had a long conversation.
	- Then I had a conversation with my [[mother]].
	- Then I caught up a bit (no completely) with [[friends online]].
