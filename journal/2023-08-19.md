- [[Flancia]]!
  - In the [[Flancia pattern language]] #19 stands for [[Right Freedom]]... and [[Revolution]].
- Visiting [[Bern]] today.
  - Writing this on the train there. It's very hot today but I think it will be nice.
  - Also trying to decide between going to [[Romandie]] or [[Paris]] next week.
- I read about [[htmx]] again during the week and I'm wondiering if I should give it a try for [[agora server]]. Right now most of its (limited) interactivity is hand-coded artisanal JS and DOM updates, and it could be nice to replace that with a better supported (yet not too opaque/cumbersome) alternative.
  - [[berner waldland]] with [[LP]], it was beautiful.
  - I got to [[Platform 10]] on time, just fine :)
  - [[Gracias]]!
  - [[Agua]]
  - [[Collected Poetry]]
  - [[AG]] :)
- [[PJ]] told me he was part of the original [[Chrome]] team back in 2009! Very cool.

  - > I'm getting more comfortable using Foam alongside Obsidian, especially inside a Gitpod workspace.
  - This makes me want to check out [[Gitpod]] -- it makes sense that you could have hosted [[vscode]] with extensions like [[foam]]. I tried to have this previously but the [[foam]] extension was not supported in whichever vscode environment I tried; it's cool Gitpod has it.
