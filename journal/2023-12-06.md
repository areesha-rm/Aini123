- Woke up feeling a lot better!
  - 7h of sleep breathing acceptably make a lot of difference.
  - [[2023-12-05]]: I ended up feeling better after I was finally able to take a nap late in the afternoon. In the evening I did some open source coding, [[december adventure]]. Enjoyed it a lot!
- [[dentist]] appointment -- I tested negative for Covid and my symptoms are almost gone so I think I'll attend (and ask if they are OK with it, like last time I was so-so).
- Today back to [[work]]. I plan to work until 20, at which time I'll join...
- The [[fellowship of the link]] weekly call :)
  - :D
  - [[neobooks]]
  - [[doing]]: 
    - [ ] I need to fix pushing to the Agora from Hedgedoc, for some reason it broke 
- In [[2024]] I want to resume work on/with [[coop cloud]].
  - Hmm, that could actually fit the [[december adventure]]?
  - [ ] I want to improve flancia.agor.ai; make it be up to date, match anagora.org.
    - [ ] update docker images
