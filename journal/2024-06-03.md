- [[work]] was intense and even emotional, it being mostly a one day workshop -- very productive. We had a great coordinator, [[Anna Raverat]].
  - then some meetings until 19:30.
- edited [[tanka]].
- reviewed [[notebooks]], which is my default activity when I start working on personal projects after work :)
