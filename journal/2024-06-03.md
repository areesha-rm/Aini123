- [[work]] was intense and even emotional, it being mostly a one day workshop -- very productive. We had a great coordinator, [[Anna Raverat]].
  - then some meetings until 19:30.
- edited [[tanka]].
- reviewed [[notebooks]], which is my default activity when I start working on personal projects after work :)
  - I had this in an old page: "Write about [[blessed bits]] and the entropy in [[Lady Burup]]'s writing", which I think I would enjoy :) She walks often over keyboards and has a knack for hacking (disabling wireless, even crashing Wayland on occasion to my surprise).
