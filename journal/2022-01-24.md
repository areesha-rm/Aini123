# 2022-01-24

- for some reason I didn't sleep very well, woke up with a headache, didn't feel fully well all day. 
  - long day at work :)
- made [[empanadas]] though and they came out great. 
- also watched [[euphoria]].
- now I'm calling it an early night and reading in bed a bit -- probably [[free, fair and alive]], perhaps some other book in the rotation.
- #push [[logseq]]
  - looking more polished, was able to load my [[garden]] again. thinking of giving it a proper try for [[outliner mode]] notes, in particular while [[foam]] is slow.
