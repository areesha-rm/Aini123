- for some reason I didn't sleep very well, woke up with a headache, didn't feel fully well all day. 
  - long day at work :) 
  - made [[empanadas]] though and they came out great. 
  - [[meditation]] also helped as usual, as did a short nap (<10 minutes).
  - also watched [[euphoria]].
  - now I'm calling it an early night and going to bed to read a bit -- probably [[free, fair and alive]], perhaps some other book in the rotation like [[the universe in a single atom]]..
- #push [[logseq]]
  - looking more polished, was able to load my [[garden]] again. thinking of giving it a proper try for [[outliner mode]] notes, in particular while [[foam]] is slow.
