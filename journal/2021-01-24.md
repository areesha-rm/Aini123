- [[push]] [[keyoxide]] wants to be [[open source]] [[keybase]]
- [[push]] [[zulip]] [[matrix]]
  - [[zulip matrix bridge]]
- [[foam]] stopped autocompleting [[wikilinks]] a while ago and it's annoying, need to file a bug report.
  - Triggering intellisense (ctrl+space) works around this -- perhaps it's better this way even?
- [[agora bridge]]
- [[gphotos uploader cli]]
- [[vera]] told me about [[dokieli]]
