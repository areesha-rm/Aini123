- [[work]]
  - tough with [[layoffs]] wave 3 going on, plus [[social plan]] negotiations for all waves
  - but people are great
- [[social coop]] organizing circle meeting was great!
- [[open letters]]:
  - [[Open letter to the Agora]]
  - [[Open letter to Google]]
- I've had [[unbundling tools for thought]] open as a tab for maybe over a year now -- should I read it?
- I ask myself this kind of question often, as I'm managing tabs a lot of the time (I have many across many computers), often on the way of getting something else done.
  - I want to trust myself to eventually do some things, like reading this, but even though I very often add things to the Agora (through [[Betula]] or manually) to keep track of them, there are so many that I will probably never get to most of them.
    - And maybe that's OK!
    - Leaving links behind is better than nothing ;)
