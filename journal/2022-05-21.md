- [[agora bridge]]
	- DONE happy about having added [[git reset]] support -- this unflaked/fixed several gardens!
- [[agora server]]
	- TODO I don't like how all the Logseq extensions render -- items look awkward in anagora.org even after processing/removing, I'd really like to fix it
- [[agora bot]]
	- disabled hashtags in moa party room as per user request
		- I think [[matrix]] is fine having opt out for hashtag support, as inviting an agora bot to a room is a strong enough signal a priori?
		- [[opt in]] is still the nicer model for social media
	- TODO add [[opt in]] support in [[mastodon]]
	- DOING add [[opt in]] support in [[twitter]]
