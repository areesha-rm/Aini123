- stayed up until >3AM yesterday evening, like a youngster (?).
	- reminded me of staying up way too late in Buenos Aires in the late 90s/early 00s
	- I think I could do this precisely one day a week maximum nowadays :)
- [[agora bridge]]
	- DONE happy about having added [[git reset]] support -- this unflaked/fixed several gardens!
- [[agora server]]
	- TODO I don't like how all the Logseq extensions render -- items look awkward in anagora.org even after processing/removing, I'd really like to fix it
- [[agora bot]]
	- disabled hashtags in moa party room as per user request
		- I think [[matrix]] is fine having opt out for hashtag support, as inviting an agora bot to a room is a strong enough signal a priori?
		- [[opt in]] is still the nicer model for social media
	- TODO add [[opt in]] support in [[mastodon]]
	- DOING add [[opt in]] support in [[twitter]]

	  CLOCK: [2022-05-21 Sat 02:02:51]
	  :END:
	- TODO think about whether to merge back [[agora bot matrix]] repo into [[agora bridge]], it's awkward that it's the only bot in a separate repo. this makes it harder to share code.
		- thinking about licensing, as I based it off an MIT repo (it is >90% new code now though)
- [[flancia meet]]
	- didn't announce it, nobody came, but it was nice having coffee while planning the day :)
- [[codex]]
	- [[podcast]]
	- [[radio flancia]] == #RadioFlancia on [[TikTok]] (?)
- thought about my [[self]] today, did some [[maintenance]].
	- but beyond the [[self]], about [[emptiness]].
	- [[agora]]
		- [[flancian]]
		- [[content security policy]] [[iframes]]
		- I'd like to be [[transcluded by default]], does that make me [[promiscous]]?
- DOING [[opt in]]

  :END:
	- [[pomodoros]]
- TODO #push [[agora 3]]
	- two meanings:
		- [[shamanic agora]] -> containerized agora -> [[podman]] in [[hypatia]]
		- an [[agora server]] UI which has three sections:
			- [[backlinks]]
			- [[node]] (the column we've got now)
			- [[forwardlinks]]
	-
- [[kasra]]
- [[real ez cheese]]
