- [[agora para los pobres]]
- [[unicef]]
- [[Flancia]]!

It was that time of the year, your birthday, when you finally got to Flancia and were able to stay for good, stay in it in a definite sense, being free from suffering.

- [[Flancia]]!
  - On vacation at home for the remainder of this week -- by default, but I don't plan on cancelling any days and working thus far.
  - Ordered coffee from [[utopia coffee]], my favourite Swiss roaster.
  - It was very nice to wake up at home after 11 nights and a half travelling :)
  - [[Fellowship of the Link]] was beautiful
  - [[Social coop tech group]] meeting as well, tomorrow we'll probably meet shortly again
