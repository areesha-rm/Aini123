- [[Flancia]]!
  - Meaning all the following go (are pushed) into Flancia by default?
  - At least from now on.
  - Could be called [[strong push]], or maybe override [[autopush]] which has been long in the making :)
- [[1]] in my personal [[Pattern Language]] stands for both self and non-self, and for [[Flancia]]
  - Today we begin month [[8]], [[August]]. I like how it has [[31]] days, just after another 31 day month -- what a treat :)
    - Two months with [[Las Jaras]]!
- [[AG]]
  - [[Ferritin]]
  - [[Green tea]] and coworking
- [[go/newsheet]] [[go/newdoc]] exist :)
- Started an actual [[budget]] again, after months of procrastinating. Felt great actually and was not even boring :)
  - Ran [[GC]] on notes/todos. It felt great seeing that many things actually got done!
- #push [[write]]!
  - [[the ending of the expanse is our beginning]]
  - [[a crash course for elysium]]
- #push [[do]]
  - [ ] make sure that mycoformat support gets into the container
  - [ ] set up fast/reasonably smooth dev-to-agor.ai flow
  - [ ] add toggle/tab for graphs (text/circles) instead of just deciding for the user
  - [ ] fix indirect go links, like [[go/flancian/git]]
  - [ ] or make indirect go links actually redirect to go links in the destination if a local definition does not exist
- #push [[do]]
  - [ ] write visualizer for braids (!) (from a March todo, quite aspirational ;))
- #push [[Carlas Sala]]
