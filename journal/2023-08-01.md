- [[Flancia]]!
  - Meaning all the following go (are pushed) into Flancia by default?
  - At least from now on.
  - Could be called [[strong push]], or maybe override [[autopush]] which has been long in the making :)
- [[1]] in my personal [[Pattern Language]] stands for both self and non-self, and for [[Flancia]]
  - Today we begin month [[8]], [[August]]. I like how it has [[31]] days, just after another 31 day month -- what a treat :)
    - Two months with [[Las Jaras]]!
- [[AG]]
  - [[Ferritin]]
  - [[Green tea]] and coworking
- [[go/newsheet]] [[go/newdoc]] exist :)
- [[budget]]
