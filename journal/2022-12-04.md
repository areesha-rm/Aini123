      - added [[edsu]]'s key, Ed is amazing by the way
    - our [[go links]] implementation has a [[bug]]
      - [[go/cwg/meet]] should work, but doesn't? :)
      - It should point to https://socialcoop.meet.coop/mat-ivs-47b-bbp as per https://www.loomio.com/d/yh0aFRbU/community-working-group-ops-team-minutes
      - [[go/meet/cwg]] works though :) and it makes more sense maybe, this is the convention in use at work.
  - [[commons]]
    - the commons will give a [[lift]] to [[markets]] if they want that
