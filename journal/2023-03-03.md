- Day off, making this a long weekend and travelling to [[MÃ¼nchen]] to meet friends and disconnect a bit!
  - And by disconnect I mean maybe be more offline, although maybe also I will end up writing in the Agora and that's completely OK.
  - I'm currently on the train to [[Munich]], looking a bit like a zombie (bags under my eyes) and feeling a bit sleeping, but happy. Through the window I can see the fields of [[Jura]].
- [[Flancia]]
  - [[Agora]]
    - [[open letters]]
    - [[Building Bridges]] -- some day?
  - [[Buddhism]]
    - I continued reading about the [[Tripitaka]].
    - TIL [[Faxian]] started his journey on foot from China to India when he was 60.
- [[Myanmar]]
  - I remembered we considered going to Myanmar back when we were in Thailand (2016?) and would still love to go some day.
