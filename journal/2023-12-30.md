- Saturday oncall at home doing laundry and some shopping two minutes away carrying my laptop in Coop -- cozy :)
  - I renamed my second work laptop to [[Sariputta]] and I already like it more.
  - Also finished some paperwork and responded some personal messages.
- [[social coop]]
  - some discussion about [[Fedipact]] and whether we should be listed as signatories
  - there were a few polls but the one that voted (majority) block was blocked, so the actual needed fraction of votes wasn't accomplished
