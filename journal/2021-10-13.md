- [[jorge olmos]] reached out about the [[agora]]
- [[wuxga]]
- [[hypha]]
  - [[compost]]
  - meeeting tonight
- [[agora bridge]]
  - testing [[agora repo api]]
    - git.anagora.org 
      - GET / crashes node due to git-backend.ts:10 not handling unset path
        - fixed, now prints help
    - api.anagora.org
      - GET / now works
      - need to test endpoints with curl
        - done -- added README.md to [[go/agora-bridge]] with curl invocations (directory: api)
    - discussed changes with [[vera]]: we want to support multiple repos so they can be forked/turned on and off independently (and have per-repo auth)
    - I guess I could use vscode to do typescript development? 
      - it's working better than vim, at least out of the box, for sure
- [[i am a strange loop]]
  - nice coverage of [[principia mathematica]] and [[g√∂del]]'s theorems
  - [[chapter 16]] has the tightest definition of self as a strange loop so far
  - [[chapter 18]] was strangely moving
  - [[non serviam]] by [[stanislaw lem]] reminded me of a book I wanted to read
