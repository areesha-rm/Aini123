  - worked after hours for a bit, it was fine.

  - Thursday with lots of meetings, but they were OK -- I like 1:1s and small meetings more than larger ones on average (?)
  - I like talking to my coworkers; they are honestly great. I will miss them if I get laid off. But that would still be fine, as they will continue existing regardless of whether we work in the same group on weekdays :)
