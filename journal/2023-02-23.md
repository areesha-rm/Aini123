- [[work]]
  - worked after hours for a bit, it was fine.
  - it seems likely layoffs probably won't happen here for another two full weeks at least.

      - really not bad considering the very concise, off-the-cuff prompt!
- [[work]]
  - Thursday with lots of meetings, but they were OK -- I like 1:1s and small meetings more than larger ones on average (?)
  - I like talking to my coworkers; they are honestly great. I will miss them if I get laid off. But that would still be fine, as they will continue existing regardless of whether we work in the same group on weekdays :)

    - I liked [[Scott Aaronson]]'s article on [[ChatGPT]].
    - At the same time I saw [[ChatGPT]] called the [[ultimate mansplainer]].
    - Both takes are right in a way, but I think the second one feels a bit conservative to me whereas the first one feels liberal.
  - [[books]]
    - Isn't it funny we are at a point in which some discount [[LLM]]s as "just learning from a corpus and repeating/combining information found there" at the same time we still regularly call books, in particular those read in our youth, formative? At the same time we can observe society to be thoroughly shaped by the language, culture, knowledge preserved and presented to us primarily in the form of [[books]]?
    - But of course I'm fond of calling books the [[Slow Internet]].
