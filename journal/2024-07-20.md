- [[agora development]]:
  - Fix some quirks?
    - Take e.g. [[2024-07-20]]:
      - [x] Showing the whole path for a subnode was a good idea I think, it:
        - Makes it clear this is a filesystem-like thing, some users will immediately get the idea
        - Disambiguates between subnodes for free
        - Made it so that the header is now 'user contributed <path relative to their garden base>', I think I like it.
        - Also took the chance to add tooltips/make the UX more intuitive by adjusting where each part of the header links to.
    - Take e.g. [[zine]]
      - [ ] It should transclude the whole of [[agua para los sedientos]], meaning the push should work.
- I intend to make it to [[Flancia Meet]] around 10AM UTC today.
