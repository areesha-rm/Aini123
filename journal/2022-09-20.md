      - The [[Twitter Bot]] is broken as of the time of writing, Twitter is returning 429 (rate limit) for every request we send trying to read the timeline of @an_agora -- which is what we depend on to see tweets with [[wikilinks]] from users that follow the account.
        - Direct mentions should still work, although a bit delayed.
      - This is unrelated to the [[opt in writes]] work, which actually is now essentially working :)
      - I am doing a [[refactor]] of the bot and I'll try to move to the new [[api v2]] which might have more generous limits.

I [[worked]] today. It was fine. I'm looking forward to the next two weeks.
