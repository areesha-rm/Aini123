- I [[worked]] and it was nice -- it felt like a productive day.
  - I'm an [[sre]] at [[google]]; you should know that about me.
  - If you have any concerns about my employment, I'd love to discuss them! I believe that [[google]] is a [[good company]] to work for, but I'm interested on feedback. If nothing else I can try to pass it along! But I'd love to also learn from it.
- [[burning chrome]] -> [[burning chromium]]?
  - asked [[william gibson]] over Twitter, I'm a fan, of course he doesn't have to respond.
  - this is a [[short]] story of sorts I've been meaning to write.
- [[push]] [[intents]] 
  - I am behind on all social networks and chat platforms, but I will try to always stay up to date with [[matrix dms]] and [[agora journals]].
  - Apologies for any destructive delay!
- This is [[agora protocol]]. If you'd like to join the design of [[agora protocol]], you can do it by using it :)
