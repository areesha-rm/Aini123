- Welcome to the Agora of Flancia!
  - Today and every day.

Today is [[14 October 2023]] and I am glad you are here with me.

It has been ages since I've in Flancia, sometimes it feels, even as time is varying.

<hr />

Here is what I call a poem: [[trees]].

<hr />

This weekend I intend to advance what I call [[open letters]]: documents addressed to groups, openly published even as they are being written.

<hr />

As of 21:45 CET I did some 'day job' stuff (having chosen it) and started a proposal (open letter, as per the above) that I had on my todo list.

Now switching to [[paramita]], planning to continue on related topics but in the [[commons]].
