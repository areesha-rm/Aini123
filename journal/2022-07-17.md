I've been doing very little writing or coding as of late; it makes sense as the week was relatively intense and this weekend I've spent mostly offline (in "[[meatspace]]" :)). I look forward to reconnecting to my plans although I've enjoyed this weekend disconnected and I think it was probably actually necessary.

Now writing on the train back from Bern. The train is pretty full and it was hard to find a seat to sit all together, it's also a bit hot. But now it's as if it was flying through the Swiss countryside, which it almost is, and everybody around me is focused either on their phones or their books or their notes (students), and I feel very lucky to be here. Which I am.

On my headphones sounds [[rainbow folding]].
