- Woke up sick, maybe a cold/maybe light flu. Ibuprofen helped.
- Oncall at work. Some meetings. Otherwise not super productive because of the above.
- [[Open Air]] cinema today -- if it's indeed open air (remains to be seen due to weather) I'm thinking it should be OK to attend after taking more ibuprofen? It's a special occasion.
- Conflicts with [[Fellowship of the Link]] though.
