- I keep meaning to write about [[dust theory]], and make the connection that [[bouncepaw]] surfaced -- an acquaintance of his seems to have arrived at similar concepts to this and others derived I have thought of.
  - To me this plus the [[Dharma]] of Buddha Gautama, as interpreted and expanded by his [[Sangha]], provides a cohesive religious cosmology that feels potentially truthful. Maybe we are the feelings, perceptions, mental formations of emergent systems in the dust, arising -- like [[boltzmann brains]] linked but disjoint in space-time.
