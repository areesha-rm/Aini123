- [[christopher alexander]] died on [[2022-03-17]].
	- It of course made me sad to learn this.
	- I like to think he lives on through his [[books]] and [[patterns]].
	- I brought up the idea of writing to him as a group last year when we were doing [[reading alexander]]/[[patterning]] but it didn't catch on, and I didn't do it myself (even just to thank him). Now that feels like a [[mistake]] -- I'll try not to make it again.

		- pull <type> in a list (at least) should auto-list all nodes which are categorized as <type> -- e.g. [[books]] should list all nodes which are declared "a [[book]]" (potentially this journal too as a false positive I would personally be fine with.)
- [[flancia]]
	- [[flancia meet]] was empty today for a bit -- I took the time to think about projects and priorities :)
