      - There is this weird redirect-to-wikipedia bug that I'm finding hard to get to the bottom of
      - First step is to reproduce in the dev environment -- for some reason it's not happening there
      - Hypothesis: it's content from one of the streams (e.g. social media) that triggers the issue in e.g. node [[Taixu]]
      - It's weird how the Agora is somehow redirecting to Wikipedia *but* Chrome doesn't show any hint of a redirect in the console or the request log
      - agora-discuss@flancia.org is now a Google group that can be posted to.
      - agora@flancia.org is an account meant for the [[stewards]] of the [[Agora of Flancia]] :)
    - Lovely [[Flancia meet]] with [[Aldhari]]!
