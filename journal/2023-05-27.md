      - There is this weird redirect-to-wikipedia bug that I'm finding hard to get to the bottom of
      - First step is to reproduce in the dev environment -- for some reason it's not happening there
      - Hypothesis: it's content from one of the streams (e.g. social media) that triggers the issue in e.g. node [[Taixu]]
      - It's weird how the Agora is somehow redirecting to Wikipedia *but* Chrome doesn't show any hint of a redirect in the console or the request log
