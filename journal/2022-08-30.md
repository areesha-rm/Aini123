  - #push [[agora pkg chapter]]
    - It's time to leave behind (for now) [[@flancian/agora pkg chapter]], meaning the Markdown file I've been editing, and move to [[Google Docs]] which is the format/medium I need to deliver on September 1st.
    - Because of this it makes sense to also work on [[agora docs import]] :) Looking forward.
      - -> This could be a great study case for the 'resource import' (instead of the current [[repository linking]]) user journey
