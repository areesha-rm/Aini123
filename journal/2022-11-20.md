- to start the day, catch up with the notifications from ~2d ago in the Fediverse! 
  - see [[shambala]] for example.
- I will do [[pomodoros]] today.
- [[coffee]] with [[h]], it was great!
- cleaned floors.
- [[ap]] visiting, we'll do [[coworking]].
  - [[pomodoros]].
    - [[containers]]
      - [x] [[docker]]
        - as per discussion in the [[twg chat]], [[docker compose]] is what I should be using as often as possible.
        - there's also [[docker swarm]], which [[coop cloud]] uses as per [[3wc]].
      - #push [[social]]
        - [[agor.ai]] ~ [[agor ai]] ~ [[agorai]]
          - [x] brought up social.agor.ai, fotl.agor.ai, shamanic.agor.ai and a bunch of other subdomains
          - nice that because of how I have [[nginx]] set up, anything I point to hypatia serves an [[agora]] by default ;)
      - [ ] update [[agorai]]
        - it turns out this was hanging on flimsy wires, nginx in a container... which apparently isn't a good idea.
        - went with nginx on bare metal, it has advantages
        - #push [[podman]] on [[hypatia]]
          - using rootless containers, user [[agora]]
          - this led into a [[rabbit hole]]
          - ended up upgrading to [[debian sid]] after several failed tries to remain in [[bullseye]].
          - got [[podman 3.4]] this way which is better.
      - [[activitypub]]
        - [ ] read the node in the agora
        - [ ] read the standard
        - [ ] read a tutorial 
        - [ ] set up ap.anagora.org?
          - -> social.anagora.org actually :)
