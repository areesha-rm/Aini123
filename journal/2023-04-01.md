  - [[logseq]] has been somehow chewing up node updates and moving them to its /bak/ in my garden; quite annoying, it somehow decided to do this while it was running in the background, maybe it doesn't cope well with the user concurrently editing the same digital garden using some other tool. This is worth reporting as a bug.
