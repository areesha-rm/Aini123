  - last day of [[2021]]
- [[octavia butler]]
  - we have: [[kindred]]
  - [[the parable of the sower]]: nice notes by [[neil]].
- [[fka twigs]]
- [[push]] [[vscode tabs]]
  - [[save editors layout]] by [[ctf0]] works for me!
  - this solves one of my issues with [[vscode]] as a [[digital garden]] editor.
  - now if only I could make [[foam]] not take several seconds to autocomplete wikilinks :)
