- Woke up in [[montreux]]
  - Very beautiful, but very fancy/posh as well (in particular in high season)
- Tried to help [[todd]]
- Went to [[chillon castle]]
  - That was a very extensive castle! We spent a few hours there.
  - Saw things like [[two handed swords]], [[halberds]] and [[morning stars]]. It reminded me of [[D&D]] and [[The Witcher]].
