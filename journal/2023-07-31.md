- [[Flancia]]!
  - Had a beautiful weekend with [[AG]].
  - Met [[Brigitta]].
- Also finally got the new [[coop cloud]] container based setup for the Agora working, with help from [[3wc]] and [[decentral1se]]!
  - This means separate containers for [[agora bridge]] and [[agora server]], as it makes sense (IMHO), and customizable Agora roots.
  - [[agora recipe]] for more.

  - from the introduction to the [[majihma nikaya]] by [[bhikkhu bodhi]]:

    - https://link.agor.ai is live in basic form, tweaking upcoming

One of the particularities of writing about [[Flancia]] is that it seems to require a certain commitment, a belief in the feasibility of facts in possible futures.
