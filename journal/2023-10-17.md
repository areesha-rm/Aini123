- [[Flancia]]!
  - [[work]]
    - I still have a cold but it was slightly better.
    - I checked with the [[dentist]] and they didn't mind (I tested negative for Covid yesterday), so I went ahead and I'm happy with the results!
  - [[Agora]]!
    - I thought of implementing ! as a short for #push, meaning that anything wikilinked and "strongly asserted" behaves the same as push: the following blocks are transcluded in the destination.
    - [[open letters]]!
      - [[open letter to musk]]
      - [[carta abierta a milei]]
    - [[hex]] numbers :)
    - I calculated [[397]] as the 11th hex number, but if you define them naturally (with one ball yielding the first hex number, not the zeroeth) it would be [[469]]
      - Still it was fun to do it in my head :) it took 15'-25' while I was doing yoga.
