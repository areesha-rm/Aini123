- My set [[drishti]] currently.
  - ([[29]] encodes [[drishti]], the concept, but it points to another day -- in this case I had it set to 2022-11-26, a [[Saturday]].)
- [[agora]]
  - [[garden]]
    - Worked on [[prime]] just for the fun of it.
    - Led to resuming long paused [[executable subnode]] work -- fun stuff!
  - [[agora server]]
    - It wasn't clear what the right way to implement the above; for now I'm going the [[push]] path, as that's one place where costly stuff gets calculated.
- [[social coop]]
  - [[twg]]
    - [[hypha]]
- [[flancia]]
  - [[eight pomodoros for the revolution]]
  - but first, [[yoga]]: [[go/move/26]] :)
  - [[pomodoros]]
    - morning and early afternoon
      - do laundry
    - evening
      - [ ] moa party -> twg (offer, already synced with [[bmann]])
      - containers
        - my [[drishti]] today
        - [ ] [[agor.ai]] wildcard cert and nginx configuration?
        - [ ] make Dockerfile take an Agora directory in the *host*, like it is common practice it seems
        - [ ] bring up [[bonfire]] and/or [[takahe]] ~ [[TakahÄ“]]
        - [ ] bring up something in jointhefederation.org
          - My default would be an Agora ;) It can be served by federation.agor.ai.
      - [[agora]]
        - [[UI]]
          - [ ] [[executable subnodes]]
            - [ ] can totally work pretty much as is (in the branch) if we have an [[allowlist]]
          - add more effective [[default handler]] to agora server
            - [ ] it gives errors for /x/y for example, which I've been assuming works for a long while without actually having gone and made it work :)
        - #push [[agora chapter]] 
          - [ ] my next [[drishti]] -> [[2022-12-04]] is the [[deadline]]
          - [ ] answer [[editors]]
          - [ ] start going through comments and incorporating learnings
          - note that UI improvements can yield more interesting screenshots
            - [ ] but at least one screenshot of an agora graph is long due
  - [[fractal football]] :)
    - #Argentina #Mexico
