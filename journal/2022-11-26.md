- My set [[drishti]] currently.
  - ([[29]] encodes [[drishti]], the concept, but it points to another day -- in this case I had it set to 2022-11-26, a [[Saturday]].)
- [[agora]]
  - [[garden]]
    - Worked on [[prime]] just for the fun of it.
    - Led to resuming long paused [[executable subnode]] work -- fun stuff!
  - [[agora server]]
    - It wasn't clear what the right way to implement the above; for now I'm going the [[push]] path, as that's one place where costly stuff gets calculated.
- [[social coop]]
  - [[twg]]
    - [[hypha]]
- [[flancia]]
  - [[eight pomodoros for the revolution]]
  - but first, [[yoga]]: [[go/move/26]] :)
  - [[pomodoros]]
    - [ ] moa party -> twg (offer, already synced with [[bmann]])
    - containers
      - [ ] [[agor.ai]] wildcard cert and nginx configuration?
      - [ ] make Dockerfile take an Agora directory in the *host*, like it is common practice it seems
      - [ ] bring up [[bonfire]] and/or [[takahe]] ~ [[TakahÄ“]]
      - [ ] bring up something in jointhefederation.org
        - My default would be an Agora ;) It can be served by federation.agor.ai.
