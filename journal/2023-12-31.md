  - a [[poem]]:
    - Las Jaras, qué jaras?
    - Las tiradas con recta intención:
    - Las de Maitreya;
    - Las de Avalokiteshvara;
    - Las de Tara!
- [[Silvester]]:
  - As they call it here in Switzerland.
  - Happy [[2024]] all! May it be free from suffering to as many beings as possible.
  - Going to a party tonight!
- [[bedbugs]]: 
  - Still going through [[The Great Wash]], as this period of doing lots of laundry to make sure no bed bugs (fully developed or in egg form) survive in clothes and bedlinen.
  - I've been trying to do loving kindness with the bed bugs as individuals and as a species, even as they are dying in droves in the fumigated bedrooms.
- [[2024]]:
  - Thinking of planning.
