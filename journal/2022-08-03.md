- I [[worked]]
- â€¦and then I got home at about 20:15. I have about four hours of evening left; what to do? below each checkbox stands for [[30 minutes]] / a loose [[pomodoro]]
  - what I planned:
    - [ ] agora pkg chapter
      - at least read and fix egregious consistency issues and regressions I probably introduced by writing way too late in the evening the other day
    - [ ] prep for fellowship of the ring tomorrow?
      - answer email
    - [ ] one remaining thing from work maybe (CL)
      - or perhaps I shouldn't?
    - [ ] water plants
      - mine and my neighbors'
    - [ ] yoga, exercise
      - it's very hot but at least 15' of yoga would be nice
    - [ ] socializing (chat) while I cut my hair
    - [ ] shower and prep for bed
    - [ ] read
- the above is probably not a realistic plan as usual, let's see if it's a useful one?
  - what happened:
    - ?
