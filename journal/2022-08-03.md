- I [[worked]]
- â€¦and then I got home at about 20:15. I have about four hours of evening left; what to do? below each checkbox stands for [[30 minutes]] / a loose [[pomodoro]]
  - what I planned:
    - [ ] agora pkg chapter
      - at least read and fix egregious consistency issues and regressions I probably introduced by writing way too late in the evening the other day
    - [ ] prep for fellowship of the ring tomorrow?
      - answer email, I've been meaning to do this for days!
    - [ ] one remaining thing from work maybe (CL)
      - or perhaps I shouldn't?
   - [ ] yoga, exercise
      - it's very hot but at least 15' of yoga would be nice
    - [ ] some socializing (chat) while I cut my hair
      - does this pairing work? maybe
      - also check payment on behalf of [[l]] 
    - [x] [[social coop]]
      - [ ] [[next action]] -> [[debug registration issues]] with [[mica]]
    - [ ] shower and prep for bed
      - shower takes me ten minutes, but there's a lot of extra stuff here usually -- loading dishwasher may go here if not earlier (ideally earlier)
    - [ ] read
      - [[dalai lama]] / [[shantideva]] probably?
- the above is probably not a realistic plan as usual, let's see if it's a useful one?
  - what happened:
    - started scrolling Twitter but caught myself in time and stopped it
    - realized I didn't schedule anything directly about this month's [[node club]] above -- although [[agora pkg chapter]] is related on second thought
    - went out in the balcony to spend some time with [[Lady Burup]] while [[Nils Frahm]] was playing
      - [ ] watering plants makes sense with this now
