- I [[worked]].
  - It was actually pretty nice. I am privileged working in a place like [[Google]].
- Then I visited [[Flancia]].
  - My family (brother and mother) are in town!
  - We'll go to some nice places this weekend.
  - I thought of [[Agora protocol]] as it relates to my [[intents]].
    - Wrote in it relatively long, which felt nice; it helped cleared up my thoughts a bit.
  - An [[Agora]] is:
    - a [[pattern]]
      - a [[repository]] of [[patterns]]
        - used for [[good]]
