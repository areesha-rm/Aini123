  - was tough
    - it started well with a reassuring conversation with a mentor, but the day ended with more conflict again in the employee representation group.
    - the sub-group within the group I am in -- I find really draining; it is one of the most difficult groups I've been in, in part because of a personality mismatch between myself and the rest of the group and because of the high stakes/high stress situation.
    - apparently the group really really doesn't like my way of being/acting/requesting information and reasons for why we do things the way we do. i find them overly hierarchical, surprisingly conservative, and IMHO sometimes uncharitable and rash (some of them).
    - I am thinking of stepping down from said subgroup but I think I will wait until after my holidays, which are imminent :)
