- [[2022]]
  - Happy new year! I hope you thrive.
  - Please let me or [[flancia collective]] know if we can help with anything.
  - It is my intent for this year to bring Flancia closer to reality, to improve the Agora for others, and in [[january 2022]] in particular to try to behave a bit more like a [[monk]] whenever I can.
