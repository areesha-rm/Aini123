- [[2022]]
  - Happy new year! I hope you thrive.
  - Please let me or [[flancia collective]] know if we can help with anything.
  - [[push]] [[2022 resolutions]]
    - It is my intent for this year to bring [[Flancia]] closer to reality and to improve the [[Agora]] for others. 
    - In [[january 2022]] in particular I'll try to behave a bit more like a [[monk]] whenever I can: meditate more, crave less.

- started watching [[hyperland]] last night. I'm enjoying it!
  - couldn't help feeling it's awesome how so many people (4.5B as of today?) *did* get amazing connectivity and software agents -- although our agents today are unfortunately less eager to be customized than that in the show (the internet as of the late 10-15 years hasn't been exactly about empowering users to do as they please, it would seem.)
