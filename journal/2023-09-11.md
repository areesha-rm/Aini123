  - Imagine a public global debate about the crimes of [[Moloch]], and the ways to move forward.
- #push [[democracy]]
  - Imagine calling elections in every nation-state currently recognized by the UN, in addition to those called by the state in question -- put succinctly, imagine the citizens of the internet calling for liquid-democracy-based fair elections for Russia, United States, China -- a priori without the authorization of the states in question, but with an intent to cooperate rationally with them.
