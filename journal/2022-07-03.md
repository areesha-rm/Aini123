      - [ ] write [[chapter outline]] by EOD
        - [x] decide where should I write it?
          - hedgedoc is the default?
            - a shame I haven't set up oauth, but maybe it doesn't matter. I can use the stoa by default and see what happens (tm).
          - [[overleaf]] could have made sense but it actually doesn't as the format to deliver the chapter is actually [[markdown]].
          - well, what about just [[vim]]? :)
        - [x] locate chapter outline guidelines in the [[pkg book]] website if there are any
          - none found, but 20 pages a4 max for the full chapter is a nice bit of information to frame it
