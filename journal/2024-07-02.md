- [[work]] was alright :)
  - most of the meetings of the week are past, will now try to focus in decent blocks :)

  - [[catharsis]]
  - [[music]]

I've started recording my screen more often, as a way of screencasting -- even though very often I don't get to actually publish it. I have a [[Youtube channel]] but I mostly upload Yoga sessions there, at least so far. Still, just recording sometimes makes me feel reassured -- because theoretically that means I may get to actually publish it in the future, or because others will find these files and look for anything [[interesting]] in them, or because even if they are lost they will influence my behavior in some ways.

I sometimes feel that I think and write more coherently when I remember to think about you, dear [[reader]], dear [[viewer]], please [[like]] and [[share]] if willing :)

I wrote the above, which I'm calling [[2024-07-02]], and then I'm moving on to do whatever's next in the list, or whatever arises.

I was thinking recently of 

--

An alien and a human go into a bar.

The alien asks: how many drinks are you having?

The human says: just one.

- One what?
- One drink.
- That's in this reality, what about the imaginary part?
- What do you mean?
- In how many timelines are you right now?
- What... what do you mean? Just the one
- One reality?
