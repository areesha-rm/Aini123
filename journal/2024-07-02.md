- [[work]] was alright :)
  - most of the meetings of the week are past, will now try to focus in decent blocks :)

I've started recording my screen more often, as a way of screencasting -- even though very often I don't get to actually publish it. I have a [[Youtube channel]] but I mostly upload Yoga sessions there, at least so far. Still, just recording sometimes makes me feel reassured -- because theoretically that means I may get to actually publish it in the future, or because others will find these files and look for anything [[interesting]] in them, or because even if they are lost they will influence my behavior in some ways.

I sometimes feel that I think and write more coherently when I remember to think about you, dear [[reader]], dear [[viewer]], please [[like]] and [[share]] if willing :)
