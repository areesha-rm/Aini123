    - one of [[fellini]]'s classics I never saw it seems
    - "The magnificent Giulietta Masina (Fellini's wife) plays an eternally optimistic Rome streetwalker with a heart of gold and a head of cotton candy in her husband's Oscar-winning masterpiece. This funny, poignant classic inspired the musical "Sweet Charity" and is a must-see for Fellini fans."
