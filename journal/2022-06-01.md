- First of June! Feels significant somehow.
  - One month to the quarter (and to do my OKRs at work).
  - Seven months to go in the year.
  - I start this month single for the first time in 10 years.
  - In some Flancias the revolution started one month after [[international workers day]].
    - One month for planning, then a call to action?
- [[fl√¢neuse]] == [[calico fisk]]
- I really want to implement:
  - [ ] That script/function to gather all known TODOs from a garden in one place.
  - [ ] [[path tracking]] (for the user) in the Agora.
