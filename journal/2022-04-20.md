- Fourth day in [[Granada]]; very rainy and cold today, so mostly staying in. Nice for a change!
- #push [[dalai lama]]
    - Finished [[the universe in a single atom]] a few days back. Liked it, my opinion of the [[14th dalai lama]] only seems to increase the more I get acquainted with him.
- #push [[murray bookchin]]
    - Reading the introduction to [[the next revolution]] -- nice recap of his life and work.
