- [[work]]
  - very tired after only about four hours of solid sleep; jetlag kicked in, and [[Burup]] was rattled because of a curious vision (I should write more about that)
  - but work was fine :)
- then [[fellowship of the link]]
- then [[flancia]], or rather Flancia at all times in a way
  - I've been trying to enjoy life more overall, not draw hard lines between Flancia and non-Flancia most of the times
  - this seems to result in increased happiness, equanimity, which makes sense
  - meditating every morning ten minutes and doing yoga most evenings really goes a long way
