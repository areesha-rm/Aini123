  - I'd love to read more about [[groups]] as a mathematical entity.
  - > In [[mathematics]], a [[group]] is a set and an operation that combines any two elements of the set to produce a third element of the set, in such a way that the operation is associative, an identity element exists and every element has an inverse. 
  - > These three axioms hold for [[number systems]] and many other mathematical structures. For example, the integers together with the addition operation form a group.
