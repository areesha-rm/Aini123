- got a proper [[prc test]] today, as it was near home/quick and easy and it seemed good to be 100% sure this is [[covid]]
	- that swab always goes deeper than I expect!
- doing some light [[work]]
- then trying to [[ship]] some improvements to [[anagora]], but might finish it tomorrow depending on level of energy :)
	- branch is 'recursive' in [[go/agora-server]]
