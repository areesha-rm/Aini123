- This May I'm trying to get back into writing in [[node club]] -- enjoying it so far!
  - This month the default topic is [[digital capitalism]] :)
- [[worked]]
- Then I thought of:
  - [[Avalokiteshvara]]
  - [[Maitreya]]
  - [[Tara]]
  - [[Lady Burup]]
  - [[AG]]
  - my friends in general!
- I found out that [[Hannu Rajaniemi]] is Finnish, not "south asian" (?) as I initially thought :)
