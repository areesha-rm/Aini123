- This May I'm trying to get back into writing in [[node club]] -- enjoying it so far!
  - This month the default topic is [[digital capitalism]] :)
- I [[meditated]] -- I do not usually mention that I meditate 10 minutes in the morning but I do -- and it makes a great difference to pretty much any day in my experience/according to my perceptions!
- I [[worked]]
- Then I thought of:
  - [[Avalokiteshvara]]
  - [[Maitreya]]
  - [[Tara]]
  - [[Lady Burup]]
  - [[AG]]
  - my friends in general!
  - [[light]]
  - [[entanglement]]
  - [[magnetism]]
  - [[open letters]]
  - [[open source]]
- I found out today that [[Hannu Rajaniemi]] is Finnish, not "south asian" (?) as I initially thought :)
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannu_Rajaniemi born 1978.
- I listened to [[flow state]].

Not necessarily in that order :)

I like [[silver bullet]] but I come back to [[wiki vim]] because it's on the terminal and that's where I sometimes want to write.

I like [[senegal town]].
