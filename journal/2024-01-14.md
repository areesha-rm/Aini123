- [[Suffering]] came and went on [[2024-01-13]]
- This year I'd like to explore the [[Jhanas]] more.
  - I picked up [[Leigh Brasington]]'s [[Right Concentration]] again.
- I upgraded [[ubuntu]] and that somehow broke [[poetry]].
  - -> [[install poetry]] fixed it
- [[open letters]]:
  - I'm reading [[Carta Abierta a Buenos Aires Violento]] by [[Eduardo Gudiño Kieffer]].
    - On its back cover there's a list of other open letters that publishing house [[Emecé]] put out in the 70s, by:
      - [[André Maurois]]
      - [[Salvador Dalí]]
      - [[André Soubiran]]
      - [[Jean Cau]]
      - [[Robert Escarpit]]
      - [[Françoise Parturer]]
      - [[Jen François Revel]]
      - [[Gilbert Cesbron]]
      - [[Alfred Fabre-Luce]]
      - [[Silvina Bullrich]]
      - [[Ulyses Petit de Murat]]
      - [[Jean Fourastié]]
    - I notice that besides Gudiño Kieffer, Dalí and Bullrish they all seem/sound French. I wonder if there was a significant Open Letter movement in France for some reason? I will research it.
