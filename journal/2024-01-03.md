  - [ ] make it so that [[opensearch]] document is utf-8 so chrome stops ignoring Agora Search (presumably) :)
    - I think the actual issue is that new Chrome only loads [[opensearch]] data when the user performs a search *in the root of the webpage*, e.g. https://anagora.org -- and currently the Agora just redirects to /index so this never happens. Hmm.
      - [ ] Maybe I should just remove that redirect.
