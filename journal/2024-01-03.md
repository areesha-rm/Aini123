- All my computers tend to be melting down all the time. They run out of RAM and CPU. It all feels quite un-ecological, but I guess we're all betting on becoming a higher level [[kardashev]]?

    - This led me to [[future studies]].
- [[work]]
- [[fotl]]
- [[agora development]]
  - [x] make it so that [[opensearch]] document is utf-8 so chrome stops ignoring Agora Search (presumably) :)
    - I think the actual issue is that new Chrome only loads [[opensearch]] data when the user performs a search *in the root of the webpage*, e.g. https://anagora.org -- and currently the Agora just redirects to /index so this never happens. Hmm.
      - [ ] Maybe I should just remove that redirect.
