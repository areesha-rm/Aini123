- Flying to the [[US]]!
  - Not staying super long, but I'm attending a wedding and visiting a few museums I've never visited before.
  - I slept badly tonight, and the day before, due to different reasons -- the first night it was due to trip prep, the second it was due to a (surprise, as usual) allergy attack that kept me up/very uncomfortable until late. Happy to have made it to the flight only looking slightly like a cat (because of how my eyes swell, I get a bit of a feline look for hours-days after an attack).
  - Listening to [[Lex Fridman]] with [[Jimbo Wales]] on topics like the history of wikipedia. Very interesting as most Lex conversations I've heard as of late!
- [[Agora]]
  - I'm back in the Agora, finally :) I took a more prolonged break from journaling as I moved with [[Lady Burup]] temporarily to [[AG]]'s place (she is very kind!) and I adapted my routine to that space; also I've been busy at work and with other projects.
  - Thank you [[neil]] for keeping the journaling section of the Agora alive and interesting!
