- [[push]] [[gitea]]
  - [[vera]] installed gitea this weekend; just set it up so it's serving on https://git.anagora.org. Signups (username+password works just fine) open!
  - [[mirroring]] works great! simple to set up
    - I wonder how often it syncs -- if often enough, this could be a good UI for [[agora bridge]]
  - [[wiki]] for each repo gets stored in a 'hidden' repo associated with it: add .wiki before .git in the URL to clone
- [[push]] [[systemctl]]
  - `systemctl list-unit-files | grep enabled` to list all enabled services (add --user for user-scoped)
    - a bit weird this isn't... shorter? but oh well
