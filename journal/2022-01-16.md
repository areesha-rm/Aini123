# 2022-01-16

- [[gitea]]
  - [[vera]] installed gitea this weekend; just set it up so it's serving on https://git.anagora.org. Signups (username+password works just fine) open!
- [[push]] [[systemctl]]
  - `systemctl list-unit-files | grep enabled` to list all enabled services (add --user for user-scoped)
    - a bit weird this isn't... shorter? but oh well
