- I worked, it was fine -- I almost didn't as we were just returned from beautiful [[Ischia]] yesterday and Thursday is a national holiday, but in the end it was good as I made progress on several fronts and meetings were light for a Tuesday :)
- Then I did some [[social.coop]] following up on some of yesterday's topics from the [[twg]]
- I thought of:
  - [[Magnets]] as usual ;)
    - New today, but also recurrent in a way:
      - About [[Magnets in space]]
      - About [[Magnetic computing]]
    - About [[free energy]] and [[entropy]] :)
  - By the way any of the ideas I write down, which I'm sure are old hat to any physicist and many common folk like me, are for the benefit of all beings if they ever turn out to be useful in any way; any [[patents]] are dedicated to the benefit of humanity and friends :)
  - [[Agora letters]]
    - Maybe sounds a bit better than just [[Open Letters]] for what I am trying to do -- at least for me :) Because these are open letters with a particular intention? Or at least that's a particular interesting subset of all [[open letters]] tracked in this [[Agora]] and elsewhere in the [[Internet]].

Today and yesterday I thought also of writing, in general -- how much I do it and how much I don't, how many of my thoughts seep into the ether as weak electromagnetic radiation and are only occasionally recorded. (That's alright; with every thought "lost" we radiate some heat, we feel something, we experiment our beings and let the universe shape our consciousnesses).

For the purpose of focusing more often on writing I've started to think of [[Sariputta]] as my writing computer, keeping also [[Sila]] and [[Paramita]] as general purpose/development computers, and [[Nostromo]] as media centre/MIDI terminal.
