# 2020-11-03

- Back to work today. I plan to work 10-19; started a bit earlier technically, will take some breaks to compensate. I do need to finish a few things today, though. Will try to keep myself accountable.
- [[ablueaeshna]] reviewed their note in the Agora: https://twitter.com/ablueaeshna/status/1323439284272222208
  - Discussed [[gwern]].
- [[poll]] results:
  - People preferred /garden/ over other options for Agora paths: https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1322602649594793985
  - People seemed to be ok with 'node' as the default abstraction in the Agora.
- Started discussing [[social credit]] with [[steven-fan]] but had to drop out (I was drained yesterday evening because of unrelated issues): https://twitter.com/_StevenFan/status/1323149238788788224
- Next:
  - Add 'dark mode' to the Agora, I like this kind of scheme: https://twitter.com/ablueaeshna/status/1323439284272222208/photo/1
