- [[Flancia]]!
  - is a [[Pattern Language]].
- I watched [[Star Trek]] with a [[friend]].
  - Loved it.
  - I started with episode 10 of the third season of [[Picard]] having watched none of it except the very first episode of season one.
  - I don't know much of what has happened thus far but I went in fully willing and I liked it a lot.
  - Since about half an hour into it I thought of it as a [[quantum flip]].
  - I was surprised that the Borg and the Federation didn't seem to engage in dialog, but I decided to interpret the episode itself as the conversation between them. Hear me out.
  - I love [[Seven of Nine]] immediately.
