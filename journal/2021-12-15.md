# 2021-12-15

- had a reasonably productive day working on the [[agora]] yesterday, as I didn't work on the day job (had the day off, [[time off in lieu]])
  - felt great.
  - I did cause one outage, but it was only 5 minutes long, so it wasn't too bad :)
  - still need to
    - [ ] fix bug: fedwiki gardens are imported one level too deep in the garden structure due to the changes for having agora-root-qualified targets (akin to mountpoints onto the top level agora repo)
- worked today, had an OK day including a good 2022 roadmap review for my team.
- will meet [[geordie keitt]]
