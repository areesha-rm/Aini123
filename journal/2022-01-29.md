		- #push [[anchors]]
			- I'd been thining about anchors due to [[obsidian block anchors]] and the topic came up again today; [[bouncepaw]] is thinking about many of the same things. We decided to try to work on [[anchors]] together; try to agree on shared conventions.
			- [[anchors]] for me generalize to the problem of transmitting [[context]], [[scope]]. I've been exploring these problems with [[push]] and [[pull]].
	- caught up with [[metasj]] in the evening too, about the [[commons]] and [[shared pools]].

				- https://github.com/maubot/rss
				- https://github.com/maubot/ping
				- #push [[agora bot matrix]]
					- is now up and running in [[agora discuss]] and [[agora development]]
					- based it on https://github.com/TomCasavant/RedditMaubot which is a bit of a joke bot, but as an example it was good enough ;) and MIT licensed
					- in its own git repo for now, might just move all code to [[agora bridge]] so it coexists with social media bots though?
- we bought a lot of chocolate today to bring as gift to family and friends :)
