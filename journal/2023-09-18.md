- [[18]] is [[right understanding]] in the [[flancia]] [[pattern language]].
  - Flancia is in some ways a [[calendar]]. I usually revisit the Flancia Pattern language daily, considering the day of the date as my default focus.
- [[drishtis]] ~ [[29]] as 29 tends to remind me of items on which my focus is trained on by default in the running month.
  - on this note [[7]] and [[17]] this month were beautiful as usual
  - [[20]] ~ [[agora slides]] this month as I'll present it to [[fotl]] in whichever shape it is :)
