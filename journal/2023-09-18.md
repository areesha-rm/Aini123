- [[18]] is [[right understanding]] in the [[flancia]] [[pattern language]].
  - Flancia is in some ways a [[calendar]]. I usually revisit the Flancia Pattern language daily, considering the current date as my default focus.
- [[drishtis]] ~ [[29]] might be particularly interesting as it is a list; 29 tends to remind me of items on which my focus is trained on by default in the running month.
  - on this note [[7]] and [[17]] this month were beautiful as usual
  - [[20]] ~ [[agora slides]] this month as I'll present it to [[fotl]] in whichever shape it is :)
- At this point I decided to start writing in the Agora assuming I have [[autopush]] on, even though I haven't implemented it.
  - It will work like this: if you [[wikilink]] or #tag once node [[autopush]] in a resource, the Agora will try to push blocks for you even without mentioning #push; so the following would result in [[poems]] getting a push of this node without further ado.

  - I wrote [[Agua]] again today on my paper notebook.
  - [[Fork]]
    - Fork
    - Fork, fork!
    - As we fork we'll [[merge]]!
  - [[Merge]]
    - Merge
    - Merge, merge!
    - As we merge we'll [[fork]]!
  - [[Flow]]
    - Flow
    - Flow, flow!
    - As we flow we'll do kindly!
