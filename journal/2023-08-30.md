- [[Flancia]]!
  - [[30]] in the Flancia Pattern Language means [[flow]].
    - 6 means flow also some days and 30 is 6 * 5 so it makes sense.
      - 5 means [[focus]], so you can think of it as focusing on flow or flowing focusing, which to some extent may be seen as redundant (but doesn't need to be).
