- [[Flancia]]!
  - [[30]] in the Flancia Pattern Language means [[flow]].
    - 6 means flow also some days and 30 is 6 * 5 so it makes sense.
      - 5 means [[focus]], so you can think of it as focusing on flow or flowing focusing, which to some extent may be seen as redundant (but doesn't need to be).
- [[work]] was fine :) I'm settling into a rhythm of working until late with a break in the middle, and I enjoy it.
- I attended to what I could of the [[fellowship of the link]], then a weird Jitsi bug that persisted across devices and internet connections locked me out! I couldn't see or hear anyone.
  - I'll read notes and try to watch the recording though :)
