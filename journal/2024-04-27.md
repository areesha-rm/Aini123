- Back here after a few more days of hectic travelling :) I intend to stick around in the Agora for the next few days, for a change!
- Thinking again (as per usual?) about [[open letters]] -- which hasn't necessarily meant I have been making much progress on any of them. I wonder at times why I got so enamoured of the genre even before penning my first complete one; but then again my enthusiasm is known to often predate competency ;)
- I thought about [[telling stories]].
