- [[Bettwanzen]] inspection finally came and results were relatively positive:
  - These are [[bed bugs]] indeed.
  - And, as I was hoping, they are only in the main bedroom -- haven't spread to the guest room where I've been sleeping or anywhere else it seems \o/
- [[work]]
  - yep
  - prod meeting -- interesting topics came up. I think they will feed in what we're trying to write
  - then I reviewed 5x roadmaps and edited a document I'd been meaning to dedicate time to :D
- [[flancia]]
  - a [[poem]]:
    - [[8]] syllables that are worth [[162]] in the [[Flancia pattern language]]:
      - [[Merge]], merge, merge;
      - as we [[fork]] we'll [[merge]]!
      - (3, 3, 3 -- as we 2 we'll 3)
- [[Fediverse clients]]:
  - I like [[elk]] most of all currently
  - and the descendants of [[Pinafore]], like [[Enafore]]
  - and [[Phanpy]]
- Thought of [[7]] (as an example number):
  - Numeric nodes should probably auto-pull known number-related nodes like [[hex]] and [[prime]]? In particular in the [[Agora of Flancia]] these contains utilities.
- [[december adventure]]:
  - [[new style pulls]] for social media.
  - [[misc]]
    - [ ] fix [[micro.blog]]? builds on 'canonical' concept which I've tackled a bit previously
    - [ ] reintroduce autopull/pull all and fold all
      - in the sense of a button that pulls resources - maybe on both agora-level and node-level?
      - [ ] also maybe s/search/go/, try it out
        - would interact nicely with that old [[double click]] idea: if you're already at the node and you press go, it redirects to the go link if there is one known
- thought about [[web rings]]:
