- Last day of [[vacation]]; tomorrow I go back to work.
  - My mum leaves today. It was very nice seeing her on both ends of my travel!
  - We played [[Rummy]] and had beautiful conversations. We also played with [[Lady Burup]].
- [[done]]
  - Yesterday I paid [[bills]].
  - I pushed [[async agora]] to production, meaning anagora.org, and it's holding up quite well! I notice an improvement in speed, which I know is only partially there -- nodes load as slowly as ever on a cache miss, but the fact that the UI doesn't block on it really helps. I can start reading wikipedia or move on to a web search before the node fully loads. It just feels more responsive.
