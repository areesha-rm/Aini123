- Traveling to the [[US]] after three years!
  - For [[work]] but of course I'll try to enjoy the weekends as mini vacations (without going too crazy, I need rest).
  - Will be meeting friends in [[Raleigh]], [[Seattle]] and [[Portland]].
  - I plan to keep a travel journal in [[us trip 2022]], let's see if it sticks.
- [[agora]]
  - Discussed options with [[mohammed]].
  - Lots of pending messages, I'll try to catch up on my free but jetlagged day after I get to [[Durham]].
  - [[agora server]]
    - [ ] review next action, see pending items from the weekend?
  - [[agora bridge]]
    - [ ] opt in writes is still pending and it seems relatively straightforward to do
