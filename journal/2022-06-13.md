- Traveling to the [[US]] after three years!
  - For [[work]] but of course I'll try to enjoy the weekends as mini vacations (without going too crazy, I need rest).
  - Will be meeting friends in [[Raleigh]], [[Seattle]] and [[Portland]].
  - I plan to keep a travel journal in [[us trip 2022]], let's see if it sticks.
- [[agora]]
  - Discussed options with [[mohammed]].
  - Lots of pending messages, I'll try to catch up on my free but jetlagged day after I get to [[Durham]].
  - [[agora server]]
    - [ ] review next action, see pending items from the weekend?
  - [[agora bridge]]
    - [ ] opt in writes is still pending and it seems relatively straightforward to do
  - I forgot to check out repositories locally so I wasn't able to work on any of this in the airplane (I don't like paying for wifi).
- [[meta]] as of today, my [[digital garden]] has 247k words -- I checked using [[wc]].
  - Is that a lot? I just realized I have no idea, and having no internet currently, checking is not trivial.
    - I think a thesis has about 30k words, but I forget if that's bachelors or masters.
  - I started my garden back when I was using [[roam]] in the first half of [[2020]].
