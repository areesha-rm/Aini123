- [[I'm back]]!
  - It sure took some time.
  - But [[per aspera ad astra]]. I try to enjoy the ride :)
  - I am, after all, often
    - [[free from suffering]]

I worked half a day as I was sick; cold symptoms, nothing terrible though. I attended two meetings and did writing.

Then I read [[Aaron Copland]] on music, thought and wrote about [[Moloch]].

I eead the [[Dalai Lama]] and [[Thubten Chodron]]. I'm in chapter 2 of book 2: [[The Foundation of Buddhist Practice]].
