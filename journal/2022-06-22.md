    - I suspended some reported accounts today (it turns out you can do this for accounts in other instances, which apparently means they can't interact with our instance anymore?). I clicked on the content to confirm they were abusive/inappropriate and they really were. It made me sad and disappointed with people and less hopeful about the [[fediverse]], but thankfully the feeling passed shortly.
