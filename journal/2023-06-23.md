- [[Greece]]
  - [[Athens]]
    - We visited the [[Acropolis museum]].
    - Then the [[Acropolis]].
    - Then I saw [[Nils Frahm]].

I wasn't planning on seeing [[Nils Frahm]] live, nor did I know he was playing in Athens until the very same day it happened; I heard the sound test coming from the [[Odeon of Herodes Atticus]] while I was climbing down the southern slope of the Acropolis and I decided to get a ticket just in time. I'm happy I did so, it was a memorable experience for sure to see him live under the moon and stars in this ~2000 year old amphitheatre.
