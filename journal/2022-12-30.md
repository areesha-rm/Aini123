- worked half a day.
  - "no habÃ­a tanto, trucha" <- funny comment (but maybe not great, considering the degree of privilege it communicates) because only two Google restaurants were open.
- spent the day with friends who are visiting for New Years! 
- then more friends arrived, and we all had dinner.
- I've been thinking about [[2023]], and about [[revolutionary calendar]] (as an exercise). It won't be ready for Dec 31st -- but that's fine. It'll emerge organically and maybe it's sufficient if it's ready by Jan 31st, or even by June 31st:)
