# 2021-12-14

- continuing on the todo from yesterday, [[2021-12-13]]
- [x] [[graph]]
  - shipped what I think is a relative improvement, nodes are now labelled in the graph
  - will probably add a toggle/more options later
- [x] [[agora rss]]
  - using [[feedgen]] for [[python]]
- [[stoa subnodes]]
  - [x] write hacky export script
  - [x] set up [[git sync]]
    - hmm, I lost the repo I mean
    - found it, noded, there's several with this name so I set up a go link to the one that looks most promising
    - in the end didn't use git sync, just went with bog standard 'push' -- git sync has more value when there can be conflicts, and the git repo we're pushing to should have only one pusher (us)
    - set up a cronjob.
    - broke anagora.org for a bit while pushing code to make stoa/ type sources work :) sorry about that.
- [[misc]]
  - should really fix 'uri' and 'url' in nodes/subnodes, uri in subnodes currently means relative path (!). what.
