  - One week left maybe; I'd bet the layoffs in ZRH will be announced in one of these dates:
    - 27 February (Monday, the day the compulsory consultation with the employee representation group ends)
    - 3 March (Friday, the first Friday it's feasible)
    - From the two guesses I'd go with 3 March because it'd be the 31st of February: [[Las Jaras]].

  - Played with [[numbers]] -- I like where it's going I think?
    - [[17]] would be an entry point, but I like to think of it as having infinitely many -- like the Agora it seeks to illustrate :)
