- [[2022-12-23]] was nice.
  - met [[d]].
- today I did some laundry and some last minute shopping; now I'm writing this in the train to [[Lausanne]].
  - I'll be back tomorrow with my [[Lady Burup]].
- [[music]]
  - during the train ride I went through my old [[thumbs up]] set a bit
  - I remembered I liked some of [[Pusha T]]'s tracks, so I listened to his new album, [[it'salmost dry]].
