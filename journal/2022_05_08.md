	- refactoring [[agora bridge]] a bit
	- trying to move both wikilinks and hashtags to just resolve to whatever urllib.parse.quote_plus makes out of the string for [[agora bot]].
		- [[cons]]
			- not the prettiest -- slugs are more readable sometimes, but lossy
		- [[pros]]
			- lossless
			- a shame we can't use unicode and call it a day -- e.g. I'd rather write https://anagora.org
