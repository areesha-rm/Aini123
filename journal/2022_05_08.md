	- refactoring [[agora bridge]] a bit
	- trying to move both wikilinks and hashtags to just resolve to whatever urllib.parse.quote_plus makes out of the string for [[agora bot]].

		- [[pros]]

- In Flancia we [[hacked the internet]]
	- [[hack the internet]]
	- [[hashtags]] and part of the [[language of the internet]]
	- [[wikilinks]] are as well

	- [[revolution]]
		- The [[fediverse]] could be the [[commons]] for a [[revolution.]]
