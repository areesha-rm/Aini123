- [[agora]]
  - [[agora bridge]]
    - [ ] continue refactoring [[agora bot]]
      - [ ] [[twitter limits]] keep being an issue, go to [[api v2]] for mentions/timeline?
    - [ ] maybe look into [[moa]] code for compatibility/alignment?
      - [ ] try to find vera's CL from yore
- [[flancia meet]]
  - todo there is better structure
- created a thread for [[hedgedoc wikilinks]]
- tried [[wayvnc]], [[vnc for wayland]]
  - it works, nice
  - I may move [[nostromo]] to wayland because of this, although the hacky [[rdp]] server I run there (still on X11) tends to have better performance
