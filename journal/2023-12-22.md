- [[Avalokiteshvara]]!

Digo, ahora que empiezo a escribir en el escritorio número 7.

Finalmente exporté [[goodreads]] e importé en [[bookwyrm]]: <picture>.

- As an aside, I miss the capability of pasting pictures/media in the Agora. I used to have it in Obsidian, maybe I should run it or [[Logseq]] again.
    - They are both clients that are easier to recommend that my current [[wiki vim]] setup anyway... :)
    - [[Agora Development]]:
        - If you save to [[Drive]], [[Dropbox]], [[NextCloud]], [[Syncthing]] it should work as if you were saving to [[git]].

- I got a new [[Aufenthantsbewilligung]] and I ended up reading [[art 61]] and others, interesting.
    - [[art 68]] deals with expulsion
