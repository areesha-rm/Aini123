- [[logseq]] is getting slower every day.
  - thinking about starting to use [[wiki vim]] (not [[vim wiki]], confusingly :)) more regularly.
  - #push [[wiki vim]]
    - now I'm writing this in [[wiki vim]], in which:
      - ,ww navigates to index.md
      - ,w,w navigates to the current journal
      - unfortunately navigating to a wikilink from the journal creates the file in journal/, even though I want it in the root.
      - filed: https://github.com/lervag/wiki.vim/issues/225 
      - already resulted in a nice workaround that I can just plug into my .vimrc :)
    - It is actually really nice to be able to journal in [[vim]] again.
      - So responsive!
      - And I can drop into 'full text/document mode' pretty easily, not to be constrained by [[outliner mode]].
      - Also I now have a *global* alt-d shortcut for my journal -- that is, pressing alt-d brings up my daily note no matter where I am :)
