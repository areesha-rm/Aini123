- [[logseq]] is getting slower every day.
	- thinking about starting to use [[wiki vim]] (not [[vim wiki]], confusingly :)) more regularly.
	- Update: I was stuck on [[0.5.9]] due to an issue with the AppImage; now manually updated to [[0.7]] and it seems somewhat improved?
	- #push [[wiki vim]]
		- now I'm writing this in [[wiki vim]], in which:
			- ,ww navigates to index.md
			- ,w,w navigates to the current journal
			- unfortunately navigating to a wikilink from the journal created the file in journal/, even though I want it in the root.
			- filed: https://github.com/lervag/wiki.vim/issues/225
			- already resulted in a nice workaround that I can just plug into my .vimrc :)
		- It is actually really nice to be able to journal in [[vim]] again.
			- So responsive!
			- And I can drop into 'full text/document mode' pretty easily, not to be constrained by [[outliner mode]].
			- Also I now have a *global* alt-d shortcut for my journal -- that is, pressing alt-d brings up my daily note no matter where I am :)
		- Next thing missing is pasting media (that is, storing in assets and inserting a link). Thinking about how to solve this.
			- [[md img paste]] https://github.com/ferrine/md-img-paste.vim might be this :)
- Looked into managing my [[dotfiles]] in a more structured way again.
	- [[chezmoi]] is looking fancy and probably worth investing on?
- [[gitlab]]
  - Started a [[flancian]] repo: https://gitlab.com/flancian/flancian
  - [[Dockerfile]] is not there but should be there eventually.
- [[unlicense]]
