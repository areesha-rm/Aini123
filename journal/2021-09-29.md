- cleaned up [[contract]] a bit
  - need to establish a process for review
- set up a new workspace for working on [[flancia]] explicitly
  - I feel like I've been procrastinating on [[flancia]] without knowing it
  - long form on this follows after this section
  - [[meta]] [[agora protocol]]
    - this is a format I want to explore more: [[agora protocol]] up top, then long form treatment on some of the same topics. perhaps a sequence of (agora protocol, long form) tuples more generally.

In a sense, procrastination is just an inefficiency in my scheduling that can be improved upon. I've been experimenting with techniques to unblock resources I need to continue with threads more often; and to schedule a bit more rationally and in a [[true to self]] fashion.
