- threw [[261]]
  - leading to [[hex/10]] = [[271]]: es todo perfecto como es.
  - I realized [[hex/6]] = [[97]] is prime, the last I had yet to memorize below 100. That concludes a particular interesting sequence, I guess :) 
    - The number of primes below 100 is perhaps interesting to know: 25. So a fourth of the 100 first numbers are prime! Huh.
    - Knowing up to 1000 would unlock getting a statistical feel of how quickly primes 'thin out'.
    - Of course we can also count to 10: 4 primes below 10, so about two fifths.
    - I think they thin out logarithmically but I'm not sure which base, I could look it up but maybe I'll think about it :)
    - It would be cool if it was the natural logarithm. It's the kind of thing that could happen :)
- [[bluesky]]:
  - now has an [[agora bot]]!
  - it's alpha but it works sometimes (tm)
  - #go at://anagora.bsky.social
    - is that valid at protocol? I believe it sort of should be but I haven't checked :)
