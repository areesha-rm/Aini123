- threw [[261]]
  - leading to [[hex/10]] = [[271]]: es todo perfecto como es.
  - I realized [[hex/6]] = [[97]] is prime, the last I had yet to memorize below 100. That concludes a particular interesting sequence, I guess :) 
    - The number of primes below 100 is perhaps interesting to know: 25.
