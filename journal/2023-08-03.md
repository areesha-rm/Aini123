- Woke up sicker than yesterday, definitely feels more like a flu. Ibuprofen keeps helping.
  - Daniel at work (he's great) offered an oncall swap and I took it. Thank you! This will allow me to rest today.
  - Tonight my friends arrive -- I hope I don't pass it along to them!

  - Flancia!
    - [ ] maybe write [[testament]]
    - [ ] maybe ship link.agor.ai customization
      - [ ] figure out why abra app deploy -C does not seem to be upgrading container version?
        - It just hit me like a flash: it's probably because the code in the container is a result of 'git clone' and it's not being re-run on subsequent builds; I should probably discard the cache or figure out how to make it always rebuild?
