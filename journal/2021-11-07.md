- Sunday! Will try to catch up with reading, including here in the Agora, and also do some coding today.
- [[the name of the rose]] made me think again of the [[canonical hours]].
  - [[horas can√≥nicas]]
- [[push]] [[dinner]]
  - [[tortilla de papas]]
- [[short story]]
- [[will]]
- [[loas a buda]]
- [[la censura de buddha]]
  - [[short story]] or [[essay]]?
  - [[buddha]] or [[buda]] == [[en]] or [[es]]
- [[flancia]]
  - [[revolution]]
- [[push]] [[virality]]
  - I'm calling it: I think https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1457336641232769027 might go [[viral]] (based on ratio of retweets to likes, p=0.5)
- [[yoga with x]]
- [[tmux]]
  - I keep having to detach sessions manually because my current session is larger than another one
  - [[tmux should have a mode in which it always prioritizes current sessions]]
