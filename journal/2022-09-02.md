- (Backnoded.)
  - Yesterday ([[2022-09-01]]) we flew to [[Porto]].
  - Today we visited the Cathedral, walked along the Ribeira, had a very nice lunch there, then crossed the bridge to [[Gaia]]. In general walked around a lot, ended up the day tired but happy.
  - It was an "offline" day as evidenced by the fact I didn't node it in time :) Lots of corrections pending for [[agora doc]], but I decided to take a few days off before diving back in.
