- [[december adventure]]:
  - [[day 5]] :)
    - I'm testing what I'm calling [[natural pushes]] with this section in my journal.
    - these blocks should all be pushed to [[december adventure]] because I suffixed it with a colon.
    - I think this reads a lot better than using #push and all.
    - ! also works as a suffix :)
