  - [[day 5]] :)
    - I'm testing what I'm calling [[natural pushes]] with this section in my journal.

    - I think this reads a lot better than using #push and all.
    - ! also works as a suffix :)

  - hypothesis, in hz:
  - 134 152 134 152 311 [[hz]]
  - I will ask [[chatgpt]] to confirm, it is able to do this just fine (albeit probably inefficiently, for now, energetically speaking)
- [[agora development]]
  - having fun with it! :D
- no [[work]] today except answering a message and quick code reviews as I got up feeling sick after a night of sleeping very little + quite badly due to heavy congestion (likely a common cold)
