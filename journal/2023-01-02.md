- Today I found [[Ron Gilbert]] and [[David Fox]] on the [[fediverse]] and I realized I haven't bought [[Return to Monkey Island]] yet!
  - I waited for it (a Ron Gilbert sequel to [[Monkey Island 2]]) for almost 30 years (!).
  - I think I'll buy it now and then start playing it soon after I'm finished with [[Agora Chapter]]. I haven't played a game in *very long*, and I think it's going to feel a bit like a holiday!
