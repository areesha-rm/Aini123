- [[29]] is [[drishti]] in the #Flancia [[Pattern Language]].
- My hobby: think about whether numbers are prime.
  - [[209]] is not prime; it is 19 * 11.
    - I find this one quite beautiful as there are two simple "proofs" to get there:
      - It is not multiple of two or five trivially.
      - It is not a multiple of three as its digits don't add up to a multiple.
  - [[1547]] is not prime; it is 13 * 7 * 17.
