- I've been away from [[noding]] a bit, away from [[writing]], as I focused my writing on [[Agora chapter]] for the [[Personal Knowledge Graphs]] book.
- I started [[Return to Monkey Island]] today and I'm liking it a lot.
  - I got used to the art style pretty quickly.
- [[Flancia]]
  - I think I want to call the book [[Flancia Chronicles]].
    - The book is to be assembled from my writing in https://flancia.org and https://anagora.org.
    - In the meantime, there's a [[Flancia doc]] :)

      - [ ] ship [[agora graph]] in some version?
      - [ ] [[dynamic subnodes]], sometimes also known as [[executable subnodes]]
        - [ ] ship executable subnodes with allowlist?
        - [ ] start on [[client side subnodes]], meaning [[javascript]] in gardens :)
      - [ ] easy improvement: I want to adjust the node/subnode icons back to what they were one or two months ago; a stack for a node made sense, whereas the current red book for node is puzzling.
