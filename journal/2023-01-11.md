- I've been away from [[noding]] a bit, away from [[writing]], as I focused my writing on [[Agora chapter]] for the [[Personal Knowledge Graphs]] book.
- I started [[Return to Monkey Island]] today and I'm liking it a lot.
  - I got used to the art style pretty quickly.
- [[Flancia]]
  - I think I want to call the book [[Flancia Chronicles]].
    - The book is to be assembled from my writing in https://flancia.org and https://anagora.org.
    - In the meantime, there's a [[Flancia doc]] :)
  - [[fellowship of the link]]
  - [[agora]]
    - [[agora development]]
    - [[agora chapter]] next steps?
      - read George's email.

    - worked a bit even though I had the day off, and I enjoyed getting some things done!
