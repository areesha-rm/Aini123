- [[work]]
  - took the day off, but still did 30 minutes - 1h of work to keep things moving. I don't regret it.
- [[flancia]]
  - meditated in the morning, it helped a lot as usual :) yesterday I didn't do it and I think I probably should have.
  - [[agora]]
    - [[agora doc]] is the top priority for this weekend, but I'd also like to keep it fun by shipping some easy improvements to the Agora UX.
      - I'm tracking those in paper mostly at home, but the top and likely easiest is to *reintroduce* filenames in subnode headings. Since hiding them I feel the interface is less clear. The Agora is retro, so we might as well use that -- and I think keeping it obvious that each subnode is a separate file probably helps.
