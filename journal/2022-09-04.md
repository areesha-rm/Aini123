- Today we're travelling to Lisbon in the [[Alfa Pendular]] (long distance train).
  - As I write this I'm on the train; it's modern and roomy, I have a charging spot and I'm in a comfortable position to write in.
  - I'll try to use the [[3h]] trip to work on [[agora doc]] and continue reviewing [[mathew lowry]]'s document :)

- [[agora]]
  - I think I will move back to calling text subnodes 'text', I moved to 'note' recently but I'm not convinced by the change; note is overly restrictive, and it also is too similar to 'node' (which is the top level heading).
