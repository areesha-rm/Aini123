- First journal in a while! Backnoding:

- Today we're travelling to Lisbon in the [[Alfa Pendular]] (long distance train).
  - As I write this I'm on the train; it's modern and roomy, I have a charging spot and I'm in a comfortable position to write in.
  - I'll try to use the [[3h]] trip to work on [[agora doc]] and continue reviewing [[mathew lowry]]'s document :)
- [[writing while writing]]
