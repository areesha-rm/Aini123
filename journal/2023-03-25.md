  - [ ] answer [[3wc]] -> progress on social.coop
  - [ ] fill in fraud affidavit (someone bought gift cards with a now cancelled credit card)
  - [[social coop]]
    - make some progress on wiki
      - [ ] probably do one database restore to begin with and document the process in the migration bug
      - [ ] then nudge the [[sso]] issue further hopefully
  - work some more on [[open letters]]
    - [ ] google
    - [ ] agora
  - [ ] work some more on [[containerized agora]], specifically on agor.ai.
    - it shouldn't be too hard to get a recipe put together for [[coop cloud]], and it'd be cool
  - [ ] fix hedgedoc error condition, e.g. https://github.com/flancia-coop/doc.anagora.org/commit/be8d8ea000b33e0c90799a8420ca3dc1dab5d145
