- [[work]].
  - was fine :)
- took a break from above to attend [[fellowship of the link]] and it was great.
- [[agora]]
  - [[agora chapter]]
    - talked to editors, they said good progress but needs more work -- as expected :)
    - looking forward to continuing work on it, interleaving with personal life happily
  - [[flancia]]
    - en [[flancia]] hay un [[Ã¡gora]], and [[flancia]] is in the [[agora]]
    - [[flancia book]]
      - I had done a flancia.org -> [[google docs]] sync at some point using pandoc
      - I think it's time to re-sync, taking the opportunity to improve flancia.org incrementally (as I do very sporadically)
      - And then just start writing? Even if just an outline.
        - Up to chapter [[51]]: [[Three Maitreyas]].
