- I had a great time yesterday working on [[social coop]] [[tech working group]] things until early in the morning :)
- Today I plan to dedicate more to the [[Agora]] and to its [[Open Letters]].
	- [[open letters to the Agora]] <- [[open letter to Avalokiteshvara]]
- I'm writing this from [[logseq]] -- after very long :)
	- Happy to be back!
	- I missed:
		- Being able to insert images (I think that *was* working? will test)
		- Having more solid outliner mode (w.r.t. [[wiki vim]], which is great but a bit basic in this sense as far as I know how to use it)
	- I am *very happy* to note that it seems *much* speedier than when I left. I can [[wikilink]] or [[inline link]] or [[internal link]] (we discussed names for this with [[vera]] today) and I get autocompletion within a reasonable timeframe. Earlier autocomplete had gotten slow enough I couldn't really link anymore.
