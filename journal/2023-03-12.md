- I had a great time yesterday working on [[social coop]] [[tech working group]] things until early in the morning :)
- Today I plan to dedicate more to the [[Agora]] and to its [[Open Letters]].
	- [[open letters to the Agora]] <- [[open letter to Avalokiteshvara]]
- I'm writing this from [[logseq]] -- after very long :)
	- Happy to be back!
	- I missed:
		- Being able to insert images (I think that *was* working? will test)
		-
