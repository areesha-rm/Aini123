# 2021-10-03

- [[week 40]]
- [[october 2021]]
- Sundays are for [[Flancia]].
  - [[agora]]
    - [[fixes]]
    - [[node club]]
- see [[2021-10-02]] for pending task in moa
- [[foam]]
  - installed [[gitdoc]] which does auto-pushing for me on save, like I had in [[obsidian]] -- hope it works, it sounds kind of great. pressing `ctrl-alt-a` to push to the Agora is fine but also is getting old.
