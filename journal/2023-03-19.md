  - [[keycloak vs authentik]] https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/ub7dvb/authentik_or_keycloak/
    - the top answer makes a good case for keycloak, 3wc recommended keycloak even though they don't like their IBM link -- it seems keycloak is the reliable/stable/trusted way so I think I'll go with that
