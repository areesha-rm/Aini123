- I want to prioritize [[agora protocol]] again. The node is a mess, too many ideas jumbled together.
	- Set up [[go/agora-protocol]] to point to the [[google doc]] again; it's the best collaboration artifact we have. Not free, but I think we can be pragmatic.
	- Will try to edit/close down comments. This and another doc had gotten relative traction but I somehow just dropped them from my todo list -- or never got to them. The pandemic and our response at work had to do with it for sure :)
