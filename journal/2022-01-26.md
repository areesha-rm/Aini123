- Writing this from [[logseq]]!
	- My modifications to the default [[config.edn]]:
		- ```
		  :pages-directory ""
		  :journals-director "journal"
		  ```
		- Which make it compatible with what I have in [[foam]] (I think still the default?).
		- I will probably try to take [[outliner mode]] notes in [[logseq]] and write [[text mode]] in [[foam]] or even [[vim]] (assuming I'd be mostly adding to already existent pages seeded with [[agora protocol]]).
