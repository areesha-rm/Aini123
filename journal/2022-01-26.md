- Writing this from [[logseq]]!
	- My modifications to the default [[config.edn]]:
		- ```
		  :pages-directory ""
		  :journals-directory "journal"
		  :journal/page-title-format "yyyy-MM-dd"
		  ```
		- Which make it compatible with what I have in [[foam]] (I think still the default?).
		- I will probably try to take [[outliner mode]] notes in [[logseq]] and write [[text mode]] in [[foam]] or even [[vim]] (assuming I'd be mostly adding to already existent pages seeded with [[agora protocol]]).
- Also writing this from the future ;) I realize that I haven't added any code to prevent users from writing future journals; but then again, why would I?
- Now writing in the present again.
	- Feeling better today. Slept well (about 8.5h).
	- Relatively low meeting count at the day job today, but I need to manage available time carefully anyway as there's a lot to do for my project before travel next week (if we are able to travel).
- I'm really liking the experience in [[logseq]] so far -- it's a lot faster than [[foam]] when wikilinking in particular.
	- I had gotten used to frequent delays in [[foam]], it seems, and was essentially waiting for full 5-10s for certain UI actions (while procrastinating on actually fixing the delays?).
	- To be fair [[foam]] was doing a lot more than my current [[logseq]] setup, though, as I frequently have tens/hundreds of tabs open, whereas [[logseq]] defaults to a single page view (there's a plugin for tabs that I want to try out.)
	- Installed plugins:
		- `logseq-vim-shortcuts`
		- `logseq-hypothesis`
		- `logseq-tabs`
