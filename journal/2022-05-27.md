- Love a [[friday]] :)
  - Noding this from [[wiki vim]], which I've been using exclusively since yesterday.
  - [[logseq]] people did get back to me over Twitter and it turns out that the latest [[logseq]] contains performance improvements, so I plan to use both in parallel :)
- [[social coop]]
  - [[social coop tech group]] meeting tonight! At [[5pm utc]].
    - I'll try to seed an agenda in the [[stoa]].
    - I didn't but we used the [[stoa]] anyway, I think it works nicely :)
- #push [[work]]
  - [ ] Need to book travel.
  - [ ] Need to renew my ESTA.
  - [x] And more which I shouldn't write about here :)
- #push [[human]]
  - (is this a verb? :))
  - [x] coffee with [[g]] if we can agree on a time
  - [ ] talk to [[a]]
  - [x] talk to [[b]]
  - [ ] talk to [[j]].
  - talked to [[jz]].
- [[vera]] told me about [[lucidrains]]
- [[the agora of flancia]]
  - [[free nfts]]
    - [[5017]]
- [[archive]]
  - [[twitter]]
    - [[gig]]
  - [[attention]]
- [[move]]
  - fixed playlist order
  - want to [[unhack]] in the sense of automatically support go/x/n for any x with items, direct or in a [[playlist]]
  - #push do
    - [[flash]] -- check how to flash messages, and use it to tell the user what's happening?
      - [[flash then redirect]] sounds useful, it's what I've been wanting to implement for [[go links]] when there's more than one #go in a node
      - you should be able to cancel/override the redirect
