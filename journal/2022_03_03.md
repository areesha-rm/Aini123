- Yesterday I had the day off but ended up being sick :(
	- Had a light fever, not too much though, about 37.5.
	- After a good night's sleep I'm almost back to normal though (!), although tired. Perhaps this is what Covid feels like when you're fully vaccinated? Or perhaps I'm just relatively stressed and fighting back a regular cold.
	- Now I'm back to work, but will try to take it easy.
