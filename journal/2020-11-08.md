# 2020-11-08

Trying plan/reality again today.

## Reality
- Met [[arghzero]].
- Spent two-three hours refactoring [[agora-server]]. It's unfortunately now half broken, but it almost supports [[subnodes]], [[user listings]], and has the beginning of a proper [[graph]] data structure. I hope to fix it and ship it as v0.5b [[2020-11-09]].

## Plan
- Book meeting with [[evanward97]].
- Check out references by [[neil]] (see [[2020-11-07]]).
- Review [[2020-11-07]] for other pending tasks that didn't make it to a longer term todo.
- Work on the [[agora plan]], in particular multiplayer.
  - Incorporate [[pen-coded]]'s garden after checking for bugs, currently on dev.anagora.org only.
