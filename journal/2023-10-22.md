- Flying to [[Hong Kong]] and then [[Tokyo]] today.
  - With [[AG]] :)
  - Very happy about these holidays! They've been planned for long, and as work got tough in the last few months I relied on "seeing them coming" quite a bit.
  - I'll be very jet lagged but also likely happy in Shinjuku for the first few days.
  - [[trip to x]].

As I write this, I'm roughly above [[Baku]] about to cross the [[Caspian Sea]].
