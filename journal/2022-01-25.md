- woke up with a [[headache]] again, a bit worried -- not overly, I've got three vaccines and it's still a week+ until we have to travel.
	- work was hard as I was tired (didn't sleep well either, I usually sleep well as of the last few months), and as I had two symptoms I decided to tell the team I would take it easy and work in low energy mode (no meetings after lunch, taking rest/naps).
	- just pressed [[g t]] in logseq and it sent me to tomorrow's note, [[2022-01-26]]. Nice.
	- I wanted [[g j]] for go [[journal]] :)
	- asked on [[twitter]]:
		- @tiensonqin @andotvu is it too late to change the defaults? ;)
		- IMHO [[iso 8601]] / [[rfc 3339]] make sense as defaults in general (pending overriding factors). And these settings, I believe, might make [[logseq]] compatible out of the box with extra editors.
- I'm happy about [[logseq]] managing images sensibly out of the box -- I could never make that work well with [[foam]], perhaps because of some interaction with some other extension.
