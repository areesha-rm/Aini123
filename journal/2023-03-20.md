  - I reported a [[ytm]] bug through twitter today as it was most convenient, I think this makes sense.
  - wrote [[poetry]] based on a mantra I love, then it went somewhere unexpected; I enjoyed the process, although I think it's in need of editing as everything I write :)
  - [[building bridges]] has been brewing for a long while and yesterday I got a meeting in my calendar with that syntagm in its title, it's tomorrow, I will attend
