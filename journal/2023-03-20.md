  - I reported a [[ytm]] bug through twitter today as it was most convenient, I think this makes sense.
  - wrote [[poetry]] based on a mantra I love, then it went somewhere unexpected; I enjoyed the process, although I think it's in need of editing as everything I write :)
  - [[building bridges]] has been brewing for a long while and yesterday I got a meeting in my calendar with that syntagm in its title, it's tomorrow, I will attend
  - I thought of [[spaceships]] today as a whimsical name for [[wikilink]]. I think it makes sense, at least in my mind; I will try to make a case for it. 
    - Although most pragmatically maybe just [[link]] makes the most sense; there can be [[anchored]] (a href) or [[unanchored]] (free to resolve in an Agora or other trusted source of truth) links.
    - [[vera]] mentioned that [[org]] just calls them links. [[internal links]] is also in use, presumably because they're internal to a garden; but in Agora context they are taken to resolve to a Commons. Maybe you could take it to mean [[internal to the Commons]] though.
