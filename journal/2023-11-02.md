- Several days later, here I am again :)
  - I am writing this on the [[Shinkansen]] back to Tokyo.
  - Looking forward to doing some reading/writing/coding.
- [[Agora Development]]
  - I am tired of the Agora being so slow to load.
  - There are two solutions I can think of: a hard(er) one and an easy one. For some reason I've postponed both for very, very long. I think I'll try to implement the easy one now ;)
