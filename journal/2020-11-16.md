# 2020-11-16

- Discussed [[agora-go-links-integration]] with [[ethan-plante]] on [[discord]].
- Discussed [[open source]] with [[steven-fan]].
- Ordered coffee from [[utopia coffee]].
- Caught up with [[abstractfairy]].
  - Introduced me to [[mike elias]] == [[harmonylion1]].
- [[music]] Listened to [[utopoi]] (playlist).
- Worked on items from [[agora plan]]:
  - Implemented some degree of [[agora fuzzy matching]]
  - Cleaned up badly formatted journal entries from Roam days.
  - Implemented full text search.
- Random thoughts (could be [[offline twitter]]):
  - I just realized the [[agora]] could become a lot like [[flanbook]] through projects like [[agora twitter integration]].
  - https://hackersandslackers.com/flask-wtforms-forms/ " know this: handling form authentication and data submission is the pinnacle of app development. This is where frontend meets backend: a dance of data where a person's keystrokes result in meaningful action. He who creates forms is a harbinger of a golden age: a hero who brings us to the pinnacle of Western technology." ha.

## Planned
- Get into [[flow]].
- Get back to [[paleoludic]] (email).
- Get back to [[jerry-michalski]], evaluate [[ogm]].
- Test [[roam2agora]].
- Update [[roam likes]].
- Write about [[governance]] in [[Flancia]].
- Find a way to node to the [[agora]] from mobile. Actually probably add it to the plan first.
- Write about [[stoa]]s.
