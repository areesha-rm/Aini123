- Discussed [[open source]] with [[steven-fan]].
- Ordered coffee from [[utopia coffee]].
- Caught up with [[abstractfairy]].
  - Introduced me to [[mike elias]] == [[harmonylion1]].
- [[music]] Listened to [[utopoi]] (playlist).
- Random thoughts (could be [[offline twitter]]):
  - I just realized the [[agora]] could become a lot like [[flanbook]] through projects like [[agora twitter integration]].
