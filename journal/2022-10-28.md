- [[work]]
  - 2h
  - took the rest of the day off as planned
- #push [[protopias]]
  - [[flancia]]
    - [[agora]]
      - [[agora chapter]]
        - resume working as per yesterday, bring in pomodoros
      - #push [[tana]]
        - apparently you have to get early access? sigh.
      - [[loomio]]
    - [[social coop]]
      - [x] fixed spam trap 
      - [x] but need to update the code repository
        - -> see [[next action]] block below
      - [x] invites only as I think it's the responsible thing while we make sure our registration system stays unbroken
        - [[registrations]]
        - #push [[next action]]
          - [[social coop]]
            - [ ] read technical root, re-found by [[edsu]]: https://git.coop/social.coop/tech/operations/-/wikis/infrastructure-overview
              - [ ] note it contains the top level instructions for [[mastodon upgrade]], start the process? or block on new server?
              - [ ] set up [[ansible]] and [[sauce]] locally
          - [[agora]]
            - quick [[ui]] fixes: restore filenames in subnode headers
            - try to prevent overflow from node divs, maybe enlarge node column or usable space?
            - [[pulling]]
              - auto pull wikipedia when "nice looking" by default, maybe after larger timeout
              - the pull in [[agora chapter]] should look nicer
              - pulling nodes should work the same as pulling URLs does
              - add CSS borders to iframes (would make wormholes/bridges metaphor clearer)
            - [[pushing]]
              - children blocks get pushed by default with [[autopush]]
              - [[opt in writes]] works with independent git repositories per user
              - [[sign in]] with api.anagora.org or moa.party.
            - [[agora doc]] -> [[agora chapter]]
              - continue with [[comments from editors]], read them all at least, think [[gtd]] inbox
              - [x] they suggested sticking to [[chapter]] throughout, makes complete sense, did that
