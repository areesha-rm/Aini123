    - [[social coop]]
      - [x] fixed spam trap 
      - [x] but need to update the code repository
        - -> see [[next action]] block below
      - [x] invites only as I think it's the responsible thing while we make sure our registration system stays unbroken
        - [[registrations]]
        - #push [[next action]]
          - [[social coop]]
            - [ ] read technical root, re-found by [[edsu]]: https://git.coop/social.coop/tech/operations/-/wikis/infrastructure-overview
              - [ ] note it contains the top level instructions for [[mastodon upgrade]], start the process? or block on new server?
              - [ ] set up [[ansible]] and [[sauce]] locally
          - [[agora]]
            - quick [[ui]] fixes: restore filenames in subnode headers
            - try to prevent overflow from node divs, maybe enlarge node column or usable space?
            - the pull in [[agora chapter]] should look nicer
            - pulling nodes should work the same as pulling URLs does
            - add CSS borders to iframes (would make wormholes/bridges metaphor clearer)
