- Late journal; I slept very little (3h) and was low energy (go figure), I felt depressed but that got fixed by a 1h nap (my naps are usually only 30' tops).
  - I'm glad to be here finally!
  - I was active on the [[fediverse]] though.
- #push [[pomodoros]]
  - #1 fix agora twitter bot, try to finally [[opt in writes]] with this
    - #2 then do the fediverse (that bot is working currently)
  - See [[twitter agora bot]] for next actions.
