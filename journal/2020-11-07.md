Trying out plan/reality today.

## Reality
- Picked up [[ocell]]. She was scared but chill. The people that brought her all the way to Brugg were very nice!
- Worked on [[agora-plan]]. 
  - Fixed dev/prod setup (somewhat, still plenty of improvements needed).
  - Updated [[README]].
  - Thought about the best way to support other media.
  - Sent out call for participation: https://flancia.org/go/agora-join.
- Spammed the Agora a bit :)

## Plan
- Book meeting with [[evanward97]].
- Pick up [[ocell]].
- Work on [[agora-plan]]. Perhaps in particular integrate one more garden onto the Agora.
- Check out [[c2]] more thoroughly again; interesting stuff related to the Agora keeps coming up.
- Perhaps review [[ward cunningham]]'s github, try some of the stuff in there.

## Misc
