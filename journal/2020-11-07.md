Trying out plan/reality today.

## Reality
- Picked up [[ocell]]. She was scared but chill. The people that brought her all the way to Brugg were very nice!

## Plan
- Book meeting with [[evanward97]].
- Pick up [[ocell]].
- Work on [[agora-plan]]. Perhaps in particular integrate one more garden onto the Agora.
- Check out [[c2]] more thoroughly again; interesting stuff related to the Agora keeps coming up.
- Perhaps review [[ward cunningham]]'s github, try some of the stuff in there.
