# 2021-03-20

- part of [[weekend 11]]
- [[coffee]] with friends
- [[do]]
  - [[agora]]
    - [[wikilinks everywhere]] -> [[next action]]
    - [[autopush]] for nested lists of precisely the format of this one
    - [[autopull]] in search results for all component tokens
    - implement pull [[transclusion]] as per [[creamy ricotta pasta with brocoli]]
      - [[iframes]]
      - but needs, of course, for sites to agree to this
    - fix [[go]] + [[agora search]], make it accept and decode more useful combinations
    - make default node color be green as currently in 'not found'; it matches the [[digital garden]] theme
