- Went out for a walk and to a caf√© to work on [[agora doc]].
  - I had good coffee.
  - Then I had an [[allergic reaction]]. Again.
    - Now I'm back home waiting for the antihistamines to kick in and undo the swelling.
    - Almost went to the hospital again but didn't this time around.
    - Got better slowly at home, although my eyes and throat (or nose?) stayed swollen for a long while.
