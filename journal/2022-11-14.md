    - [x] I want to clone all repos locally in [[paramita]]
      - quick fix for social.coop/community/operations repo (added home page)
      - there's two wiki-and-bugs-only repos it seems:
        - tech ops
        - community ops
      - added 'sources of truth' to agenda
    - [x] have meeting at 21 :)
    - [x] make sure the spam trap fix makes it to the repo
      - :D
