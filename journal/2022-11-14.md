  - [x] I want to clone all repos locally in [[paramita]]
    - quick fix for social.coop/community/operations repo (added home page)
    - there's two wiki-and-bugs-only repos it seems:
      - tech ops
      - community ops
    - added 'sources of truth' to agenda
  - [ ] read the documentation as it was cleaned up by [[nathan]] and [[protean]]
  - [ ] make sure the spam trap fix makes it to the repo
