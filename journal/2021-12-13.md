# 2021-12-13

- I ended up working yesterday too on incident response :)
  - It was tiring but I don't regret it.
  - I'm taking two days of time off in lieu in the following 2w.
- [[push]] [[code]]
  - [[agora rss]]
    - delayed from the weekend but that's alright :)
  - [[import stoa]]
    - [[hedgedoc]] nodes with actual text should be auto-imported into the [[agora]] so we get wikilink/push/pull/go support.
- [[indie web]]
