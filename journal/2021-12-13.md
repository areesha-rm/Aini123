# 2021-12-13

- I ended up working yesterday too on incident response :)
  - It was tiring but I don't regret it.
  - I'm taking two days of time off in lieu in the following 2w.
- [[push]] [[code]]
  - [x] [[noindex]] in dev
    - plus some slight improvement to the title of the site, which shows in tabs and titlebars
    - feel like improving the [[landing page]] now -- it'd be nice to [[graph the Agora]], I've been meaning to do that for a while.
      - we currently only graph nodes -- even improving that graph with *node names* would add a lot. hmm.
  - [[agora rss]]
    - delayed from the weekend but that's alright :)
  - [[import stoa]]
    - [[hedgedoc]] nodes with actual text should be auto-imported into the [[agora]] so we get wikilink/push/pull/go support.
  - [ ] rank streams lower than gardens?
    - so social media doesn't obscure in-agora resources
- [[indie web]]
- [[yoga 11]]
