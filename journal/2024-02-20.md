- Second day using [[silver bullet]], enjoying it a lot!
  - I like how I was able to specify a full path for a new page, in this case journal/2024-02-20, and it just worked (tm).
  - I also like the [[autocompletion]] for links it has; it is better than [[wiki vim]]'s (which, granted, maybe I didn't really get the hang of) and [[logseq]]'s (faster).
