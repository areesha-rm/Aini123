- Second day using [[silver bullet]], enjoying it a lot!
  - I like how I was able to specify a full path for a new page, in this case journal/2024-02-20, and it just worked (tm).
  - I also like the [[autocompletion]] for links it has; it is better than [[wiki vim]]'s (which, granted, maybe I didn't really get the hang of) and [[logseq]]'s (faster).
- [[work]] was tough given that I'm still not fully recovered from flu/virus and there are some interpersonal issues that take energy to deal with, but also satisfying as I *did* manage to get some things done.
  - Also my team is really great, every time I go back to team-specific tasks it feels like a breath of fresh air!
