- Writing this straight from the [[github]] UI as I don't have a garden editor set up in the laptop I am carrying with me. 
  - It is nice to have the alternative, but wow, Github sucks. I am actually often surprised at how limited it is. "Only displaying 1000 files." -- but why? :)
  - The code review/code viewing experience is... basic.
  - It might also be, of course, that I'm continuously out of patience for closed source platforms. I think I should probably move away from Github for garden hosting -- after all, my garden isn't really covered by Google's limitations on open source hosting as it doesn't contain code.
- I missed out on the [[social coop strategy day]] due to being out on holidays. It was a shame -- of course being on holidays is nice, but it goes to show there's an opportunity cost :) I could have planned around it, of course, but I didn't.
  - Thank you [[neil]] for attending and taking notes!
  - Looking forward to coming back tomorrow and resuming online/digital activities. I also promised I would coordinate the next [[social coop tech group]] session and I have failed to do so yet -- my apologies. Will try to do it tomorrow evening at the latest.
