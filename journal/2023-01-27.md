- I keep linking by mistake to e.g. [[2022-01-27]] (the same date on 2022) when I don't pay attention.
  - Which has the added advantage that it reminds me what I was doing a year ago. I like that.
  - Thinking of adding that as a feature somehow? "On the same date some other year, in this Agora..."
