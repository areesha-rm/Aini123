- I keep linking by mistake to e.g. [[2022-01-27]] (the same date on 2022) when I don't pay attention.
  - Which has the added advantage that it reminds me what I was doing a year ago. I like that.
  - Thinking of adding that as a feature somehow? "[[On this date]] some other year, in this Agora..."
- #push [[backnoded]]
  - I've been not getting to noding, in particular journaling, some days as of late.
  - If this were a blog I'd be worried, but because it's [[a garden in an Agora]] I'm not :)
- #push [[work]]
  - The decline of [[Google]] is the topic in everybody's mouths.
- Saw [[kris]] after work, we watched the beginning of [[Blade Runner]].
