- #push [[hand byte]]
  - en una mano cabe un [[byte]].
    - I just realized that with one hand one can comfortably signal one byte of information by using all index but the thumb to signal a bit in the following way:
      - place your hands ~30cm away from your face, palms facing your face 
      - make a 'call me' sign with the left hand and a 'holding a hand gun' gesture with the right
      - this is [[17]]: 0001 0001 when read left index finger to read index finger, thumbs serving as rest for the fingers set to 0 or sticking out as most comfortable
        - so I call this sign [[one maitreya]].
