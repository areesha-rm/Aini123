- Nice relaxing day! Slept well and felt like I recovered significantly from whichever bug I've been carrying.
- Had coffee with neighbors.
- Spoke to [[Berni]] who is in [[Argentina]].
- Took a nap with [[Lady Burup]].

- Read two short stories.
  - [[Goliath]] by [[Neil Gaiman]].
  - [[Todo va mejor con Coca Cola]] de [[Alberto Vanasco]].
