    - made me think of [[autopush]] and I realized maybe adding it to [[agora server]] might be easy: we're already parsing arbitrary html with #push as it's implemented as of /today.
  - [[social coop]]
    - closed registration who sent corrected data
    - I could have guessed the correct address this time, will keep it in mind for next time there's a registration without a working opencollective URL (this happens in about 10%-20% of the registrations I'd say)
    - The issue though is that most of the time the correct URLs are not easily guessable
    - Checking for working URLs should be OS system level so users can benefit from it maximally?
    - I've always thought the same goes for [[wikilink]] resolution.
