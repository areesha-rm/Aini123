# 2020-10-04

 - Yesterday I got roped into some kind of weird Twitter feud and it was *not* my favourite thing. I think I'll try to skip those as much as I can.
   - Still discussing with [[dyokomizo]] about exactly what went wrong here.
 - TODO for today: https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1312463931168813056
   - [ ] VC with family.
   - [ ] Read Benjamin.
    - [ ] Build an Agora: [[Agora v1]]
   - [ ] buy books about [[ADD]]: [[driven-to-distraction]], [[scattered-minds]].
 - [ ] Perhaps I sholld explore [[zulip]] [[interop]]
