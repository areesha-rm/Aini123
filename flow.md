    - As defined by [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]] (I can never remember how to spell his name).
    - "In positive psychology, a flow state, also known colloquially as being in the zone, is the mental state in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. In essence, flow is characterized by the complete absorption in what one does, and a resulting transformation in one's sense of time."

I don't enter flow as often as I would like and that usually frustrates me; it's low key frustration but frustation nevertheless, and it builds up the longer it is sustained.
