# Everything2

- [[go]] everything2.com
- I spent many hours reading it in the early 2000s.
- An inspiration for the [[agora]].
  - It doesn't have backlinks (IIRC), and it's fully centralized (and centrally conctrolled).
  - But it has a [[serendipity]] aspect to it (multiple takes in the same page; plus the table below to discover only fuzzily related content) that I want to bring into the Agora.
