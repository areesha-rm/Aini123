# Nick Bostrom

- A [[philosopher]] working in [[existential risks]].
- A [[role model]].
- The [[Agora]] is what I came up with when I realized [[social networks]] might be a 'grey' ball in Bostrom's terms.
  - If they can be dangerous (c.f. [[manipulation of democracy]], [[mob mentality]], [[addiction]]) they must be analyzed, understood, improved [[openly]].
