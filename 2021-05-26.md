- writing this from [[nostromo]]
- [[obsidian plugin]]
	- I'd really like to have an agora plugin in [[obsidian]] that at least easily links out to the same node in the [[agora]]; and ideally lets me know of how many notes authored by others are there in each node, or pulls them directly.
		- [[vera]] commented we could [[hack]] this by pulling a full local copy of the agora and running it as a separate vault.

The days I don't write I feel a bit lost.

I'm finding it increasingly frustrating how I can't use the agora at the day job; I run a copy of it for my own purposes, but I can't use obsidian for corp note taking, so there's some friction involved in switching back and forth. Still, it could be worse; but I tend to get hung up/distracted by lack of integration. If it were up to me I'd make all my work public and thus integrate all my writing in one agora.
