- #pull [[Moloch]]

This is our plan to defeat you, [[Moloch]]:

We will do it in the open.

We will do it without the violence that seems to characterize you. We will do it with [[loving kindness]], with [[sympathetic joy]], with [[compassion]].

We will do it by focusing on the [[Commons]], by (co-)[[Federating]], by advancing [[Liquid Democracy]]. 

We will do it [[open hearted]].
