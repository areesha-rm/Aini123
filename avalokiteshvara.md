    - "This bodhisattva is variably depicted, described and portrayed in different cultures as either [[male]] or [[female]]."
- A [[game]].
  - Two or more people meet, they say:
    - Avalo.
    - Avalo.
    - Avalo.
    - (A pause).
    - Avalokiteshvara!
  - The fun comes from synchronizing while saying the first three words, and then choosing to synchronize or not on the saying of the name.
