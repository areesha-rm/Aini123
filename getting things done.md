- a [[technique]].
	- [[GTD]] for short. A [[productivity]] method by [[David Allen]].
	- It's also a book, which I haven't read; [[Luciana]] has.
	- [[go]] https://hamberg.no/gtd
	- The gist of it:
		- Break down tasks. Be specific.
		- When go through your backlog, like any inbox (including a "main" one, your base field of operations for executing the GTD algorithms), you try to either take any needed action immediately (but only if it's short; perhaps set a threshold in seconds, rather than minutes) or classify for later doing.
		- My take: as I can, I try to expand items, breaking them down into simpler actions and tagging them (classifying them) with a greater degree of specificity. This makes the tasks more tractable over time.
		- You classify according to [[time]] and [[context]] for the task of doing. Some example tags:
			- [[next action]], [[next week]], [[some day]], [[office]], [[home]], [[project]].
		- [[next action]] is where a lot of the magic happens. At some point something needs to be your [[next action]] to get done :)
	- I'm trying using [[Getting Things Done]] in the [[Agora]]:
		- Actions are wikilinks (I don't distinguish between links and tags; they're all just nodes).
		- [[read]], [[research]], [[write]].
		- [[next action]] -> [[do]]
		- [[some day]].
		- [[agora plan]].
		- [[do]] acts as an index/root node of the GTD system; whenever I don't know what to do, I just visit [[do]] :)
