* I biked to work and I'm happy I did, it wasn't too cold and the exercise felt great both ways.
  * Now I'm cozy at home typing on my mechanical keyboard with Lady Burup (she occasionally also types, but also I just mean we're spending time together :)). 
  - I was also melancholy for personal reasons but it felt constructive, like processing.
