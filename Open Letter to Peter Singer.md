- One of a series of [[Open Letters]].
- I thought I'd write this now years ago, maybe it will finally happen. I recently heard [[Peter Singer]] again 


Hi Peter, you don't know me but I feel I know you -- through your books and your public conversations. I am writing this [[open letter]] in the hope that you will eventually find time to read it, or at least to skim it, but I do not write it with the intention of putting a burden on you; I am just doing out of the belief that it is worth thanking you, and asking you a question (which may be answered also for others which have good mental representations of your self, or might hold interesting opinions in their own right).

## Thank you

## A question

## Farewell
