- One of a series of [[Open Letters]].
- I thought I'd write this now years ago, maybe it will finally happen.
  - I listened to [[Peter Singer]] with [[Sam Harris]] again on [[2024-02-25]].

Hi Peter, I'm sure you get this often: you don't know me but I feel like I know you -- as I've gotten to know you through your books and your public conversations. I am writing this [[open letter]] in the hope that you will eventually find time to read it, or at least to skim it, but I do not write it with the intention of putting a burden on you; I am just doing out of the belief that it is worth thanking you, and asking you a question (which may be answered also for others which have good mental representations of your self, or might hold interesting opinions in their own right).

## Thank you

Thank you for your writing and for your ideas and evaluations on ethical matters as you have expressed them through your life. I am inspired by them, and by the works you have inspired. You have brought light to the world in many ways, however you care to define it, and for that I and many other sentient beings will be .

## A question

## Farewell
