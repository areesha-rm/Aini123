# Vaporwave

- [[go]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporwave
  - Vaporwave is a [[microgenre]] of [[electronic music]], a visual art style, and an [[Internet meme]] that emerged in the early 2010s. It is defined partly by its slowed-down, chopped and screwed samples of smooth jazz, elevator, R&B, and lounge music from the 1980s and 1990s.
