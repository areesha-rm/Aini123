- a [[calendar]].
  - #push [[revolutionary calendars]]
    - [[Flancia]] is a crowdsourced non-violent [[revolution]] driven by groups of people trying to increase [[loving-kindness]].
    - It takes place every year in some way. Here's a concrete calendar for the year [[2023]].
      - It is overwhelmingly likely most of this plan will *not* come to fruition as written. That's alright. There will be many opportunities in future years.
      - See also: [[2025]], [[2027]], [[2030]] and others.

# January
- Planning for [[2023]], continued from [[December 2022]].
- #push [[agora]]
	- [[Agora chapter]] delivered (finally!). It is what it is; I am glad it exists, for all its shortcomings.
	- [[Agora development]] resumes (with more time to dedicate to it).
- #push [[fellowship of the link]]
	- Agreed on planning together (share our plans) during this January.
- #push [[moa party]]
	- Start discussions about handing over maintenance to a larger group. Ideally the [[social coop tech group]].
- #push [[work]]
	- Internal milestones, including setting up a new working group in an interesting space.

# February
- Execution part of this plan begins in earnest.
- Try to contribute meaningfully to Fediverse moderation, ideally both directly (in social.coop) and via writing an essay.
