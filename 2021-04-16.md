I got a new 32gb ram module for my laptop. It turned out that I was shipped a 8gb model plus 8gb expansion instead of a 16gb (soldered mem) model, so now I have 40gb of ram. I'll complain to the vendor as now I have 8gb of ram I have no use for, but I'm happy with the upgrade.

We went to [[bern]] today to see [[d. d.]]. We met [[greg]]. It was a great day out.
