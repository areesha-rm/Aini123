I think of the color of the water. I should have realized it was not what I had poured as it looked darker than usual; it was water mixed with some juice in a way that worked, spa water[^karlsbad].

I should have asked you about it but part of me was afraid of believing.


[^karlsbad]: I initially wrote "perhaps from Karlsbad", as if wanting to make this into a short story.
