# heart sutra

- #push [[gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha]]

[[Avalokiteshvara]]
while practicing deeply
the [[insight that brings us to the other shore]],
  discovered
  that the [[five Skandhas]] are [[empty]],
  and with this realization
  overcame ill-being.

[[Sariputra]]:
this [[body]] is empty
and empty is this body.
This body is not other than emptiness
and emptiness is not other than this body.

The same is true of [[feelings]],
  [[perceptions]],
  [[mental formations]],
  [[consciousness]].
