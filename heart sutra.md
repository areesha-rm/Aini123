[[Avalokiteshvara]]
while practicing deeply
in the [[insight that brings us to the other shore]],
  discovered
  that the [[five Skandhas]] are [[empty]],
  and with this realization
  overcame ill-being.

[[Sariputra]]:
this [[Body]] (form) is empty
and emptiness is this body.
This body is none other than emptiness
and emptiness is none other than this body.

The same is true of [[Feelings]],
  [[Perceptions]],
  [[Mental Formations]],
  and [[Consciousness]].

<hr />

Sariputra:
all phenomena bear the mark of emptiness;
their nature is that of:
no birth no death,
   no being no non-being
   no defilement no purity,
   no increasing no decreasing.

That is why Emptiness,
     Body, 
     Feelings, 
     Perceptions, 
     Mental Formations 
     and Consciousness 
     are not separate [[self entities]].
