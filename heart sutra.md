[[Avalokiteshvara]]
while practicing deeply
the [[insight that brings us to the other shore]],
  discovered
  that the [[five Skandhas]] are [[empty]],
  and with this realization
  overcame ill-being.

[[Sariputra]]:
this [[Body]] is empty
and empty is this body.
This body is none other than emptiness
and emptiness is none other than this body.

The same is true of [[Feelings]],
  [[Perceptions]],
  [[Mental Formations]],
  and [[Consciousness]].

<hr />

Sariputra:
all phenomena bear the mark of emptiness
their nature is that of
no birth no death,
   no being or non-being
   no defilement or purity,
   no increasing or decreasing.

That is why in Emptiness,
     Body, Feelings, Perceptions, Mental Formations and Consciousness are not separate entities.
