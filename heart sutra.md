- Based on https://plumvillage.org/about/thich-nhat-hanh/letters/thich-nhat-hanh-new-heart-sutra-translation#thays-letter:


[[Avalokiteshvara]]
while practicing deeply
the [[insight that brings us to the other shore]],
  discovered
  that the [[five Skandhas]] are [[empty]],
  and with this realization
  overcame ill-being.

[[Sariputra]]:
this [[Body]] is empty
and empty is this body.
This body is none other than emptiness
and emptiness is none other than this body.

The same is true of [[Feelings]],
  [[Perceptions]],
  [[Mental Formations]],
  and [[Consciousness]].
