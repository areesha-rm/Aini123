# Pomodoro
- a [[tool]]
	- [[pomodoro technique]]
		- [[25 minutes]] of focused work followed by [[5 minutes]] of rest.
		- I should do it more. "I should do it more" is something that one can end up saying about  many things.
	- It signals an [[intent]]. My intent is [[getting things done]] with [[good intent]] for [[public utility]].
		- I'm trying to be explicit about it, a bit ritualistic even.
		- Whenever I notice the risk of getting distracted from the task at hand, I dump thoughts in [[later]].
	- My current running contexts or intents can be found in [[do]] (they expand into lists of todo items/trees/graphs depending on level of modelling) and, well, in this [[agora]].
		- I am not particularly great at integrating tasks into a single place for organized ordering; to solve (or work around?) this issue it is in part that I started this Agora.
	- I also use a [[paper notebook]] for day planning and tracking.
