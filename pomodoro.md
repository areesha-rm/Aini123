# Pomodoro
- a [[tool]]
	- [[pomodoro technique]]
		- [[25 minutes]] of focused work followed by [[5 minutes]] of rest.
		- I should do it more. "I should do it more" is something that one can end up saying about  many things. So I'm trying to keep things easy: two a day keeps the doctor and the fireperson away.
	- A [[pomodoro]], for me, signals an [[intent]].
		- My default intent is [[getting things done]] with [[good intent]] for [[public utility]].
		- I'm trying to be explicit about setting intents in general; a bit ritualistic even.
			- See [[bootstrap]].
		- Whenever I notice the risk of getting distracted from the task at hand, I dump thoughts in [[later]].
	- My current running contexts or intents can be found in [[do]] (they expand into lists of todo items/trees/graphs depending on level of modelling) and, well, in this [[agora]].
		- I am not particularly great at integrating tasks into a single place for organized ordering; to solve (or work around?) this issue it is in part that I started this Agora, as it lets me integrate things easily.
	- I also use a [[paper notebook]] for day planning and tracking.
	- #pull [[termdown]] for my (as of [[2022-05-20]]) preferred timer app on [[linux]].
	- #pull [[goodtime]] for my (as of [[2022-05-20]]) preferred timer app on [[android]].
	- #pull [[marinara]] is also open source and good ([[web extension]]).
