# Pomodoro

- a [[tool]]
	- I should use the [[pomodoro technique]] more.
	- 25 minutes of work followed by 5 minutes of rest
	- "I should do it more" is something that one says about so many things, if one isn't careful.
	- I'm trying to be explicit about it, a bit ritualistic even. It signals an [[intent]]. My intent is [[getting things done]].
	- Whenever I notice the risk of getting distracted from the task at hand, I dump thoughts in [[later]].
	- My current running contexts or intents can be found in [[do]] (they expand into lists of todo items/trees/graphs depending on level of modelling).
	- I also use a [[notebook]] for day planning and pomodoro tracking.
