# Pomodoro
- a [[tool]]
	- [[pomodoro technique]]
		- [[25 minutes]] of focused work followed by [[5 minutes]] of rest.
		- I should do it more. "I should do it more" is something that one can end up saying about  many things.
	- I'm trying to be explicit about it, a bit ritualistic even. It signals an [[intent]]. My intent is [[getting things done]].
	- Whenever I notice the risk of getting distracted from the task at hand, I dump thoughts in [[later]].
	- My current running contexts or intents can be found in [[do]] (they expand into lists of todo items/trees/graphs depending on level of modelling).
	- I also use a [[notebook]] for day planning and pomodoro tracking.
