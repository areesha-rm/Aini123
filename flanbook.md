- [[Social algorithm]] (the [[Agora]] is an open repository for social algorithms):
  - Define central coordination entity, by default an Agora.
  - For each useful internet platform:
     - It should be open.
     - If it's not, write down a plan to replicate it.
     - Replicate it.
     - Open it up.
  - People can contribute direct work or money. The Agora assigns both transparently. 
  - Net income goes to [[effective altruism]] or other altruistic efforts.
