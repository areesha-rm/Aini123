# Flanbook

  - A rough [[essay]] in [[Flancia]].
- [[Social algorithm]] (the [[Agora]] is an open repository for social algorithms):
  - Define central coordination entity, by default an Agora.
  - For each useful internet platform:
     - It should be open.
     - If it's not, write down a plan to replicate it.
     - Replicate it.
     - Open it up.
  - People can contribute direct work or money. The Agora assigns both transparently. 
  - Net income (after expenses related to running the platform) goes to:
    - [[effective altruism]], [[give directly]] and other altruistic and social reform efforts.
      - [[thought experiment]] https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1335550881933234176
    - [[users]] ([[profit sharing]])

  - Estimates user value to [[facebook]] at $250/y.
  - Data source seems unclear though.
