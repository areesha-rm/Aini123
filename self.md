# Self

- See also: [[flancian]].
- The self is constructed and can be deconstructed.
- According to [[buddhism]], the self is in some ways an illusion; it is [[empty]].
  - Losing your self (e.g. experiencing nothingness, cessation; even temporarily) can set you free from some of the trappings of being; it makes it evident that the [[default mode]] of being is just that.
