# Mastodon
- An [[open source]] [[social network]].
	- Most closely resembles [[twitter]].
	- It is federated; you can choose a 'local instance' to run your account, and still interact with people in other instances.
- My account is in the [[social coop]] instance: @flancian@social.coop.
	- Could provide a good identity model for other open networks, such as the [[agora]].
	- See [[flancian]] for more contact information.
- I use [[moa.party]] to cross-post [[twitter]] <-> [[mastodon]].
- I am torn on using [[mastodon]] or [[fediverse]] when I refer to, well, mostly [[mastodon]] currently for me.
