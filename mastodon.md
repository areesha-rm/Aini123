# Mastodon

- An [[open source]] [[social network]].
  - Most closely resembles [[twitter]].
  - It is federated; you can choose a 'local instance' to run your account, and still interact with people in other instances.
- My account is in the [[social coop]] instance: <https://flancia.org/go/mastodon>.
  - Could provide a good identity model for other open networks, such as the [[agora]].
- I use [[moa.party]] to cross-post [[twitter]] <-> [[mastodon]].
