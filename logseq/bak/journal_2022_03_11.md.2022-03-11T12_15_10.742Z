- #push [[avif]]
	- is looking pretty good: https://jakearchibald.com/2020/avif-has-landed/
- #push [[sundar day]]
	- for the last 2y (since the pandemic started) we've been getting [[global reset days]] -- which people widely call [[sunday]] days after the CEO.
	- will go on a short hike with my brother who is visiting
	- also plan on doing some coding :)
- [[agora]]
	- #push [[go links in pushes]]
		- testing
		- #go https://flancia.org
		- LATER does the above go link work at the destination? I think it should, and if it doesn't, it should be fixed :)
			- it doesn't, it needs to be fixed :) on second thought it is not surprising as go links handling is quite hacky, doesn't reuse the basic node assembly logic we have for node rendering
	- [[autopush]] has been a long time in the making
		- after thinking it through I'm not sure there's a big issue with continuing to parse the html we produce while rendering subnodes as a way to extract structure that can be used for pushing
		- the fact that this lets us have a single push implementation for all source formats that render similarly has a lot going for it?
		- all in all I will probably try to implement this soon (finally!)
	- I keep thinking about [[sqlite]] as an experiment to make the Agora faster.
		- the filesystem is very fast (fast enough) for the core Agora
- [[tumper]] asked if there's a way of using [[mastodon]] from [[matrix]] -- good question

	- [[matrix mastodon bridge]] == [[mastodon matrix bridge]] -> [[matrix activitypub bridge]]
