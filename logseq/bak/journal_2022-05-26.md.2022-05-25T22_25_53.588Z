- [[logseq]] is getting slower every day.
    - thinking about starting to use [[wiki vim]] (not [[vim wiki]], confusingly :)) more regularly.
    - now I'm writing this in [[wiki vim]], in which:
        - ,ww navigates to index.md
        - ,w,j should navigate to the journal but somehow doesn't -- :WikiJournal works though
