# pomodoros

- This is actually a test for autopull.
- a [[log]].
  - A place where I can write down meta/thoughts while I do pomodoros.

I just got distracted during a pomodoro but caught me in time to still be able to pull something off this round (I think). The first five minutes I planned dinner with my partner (?), essentially forgetting I had set an intention to focus. Then I spent four minutes doing planning for the next few pomodoros, which is productive but not in the spirit of the thing. Now I'll actually do [[the thing]], which in this case is making [[free, fair and alive]] resolve well in [[agora server]].
