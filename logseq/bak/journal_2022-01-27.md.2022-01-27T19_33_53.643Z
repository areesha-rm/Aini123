- [[testing]]
	- Poll if you're interested: for piped links (of the form `[[foo|bar]]`, which order looks most natural to you?
		- Option 1: `[[page name | an alias, perhaps in long form]]`
		- Option 2: `[[long form, perhaps matching the previous sentence | page name]]`
		- Option 3: `[[why don't we have both|por qu√© no los dos]]` :)
- #push [[logseq bugs]]
	- [[logseq]] sometimes 'snaps out' of my settings and goes back to writing pages in `pages/` and journals in the IMHO weird format `yyyy_MM_dd` and so on. Restarting seems to fix it?
	- [[another try]]
- now using [[foam]] in [[paramita]], [[logseq]] in [[nostromo]].
  - I intend to keep it that way for a while I think?
- worked quite a bit, but got some stuff done -- happy about it
- learnt about [[gnu stow]] for managing [[dotfiles]].
