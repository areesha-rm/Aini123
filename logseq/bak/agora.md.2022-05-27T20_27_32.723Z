# Agora

- **The Agora is a distributed knowledge graph and experimental social network.**
	- See [[go/agora-slides]] if you'd like a 10' introduction to the key concepts.
- The [[agora]] you're likely reading this in, `anagora.org`, is just one of many. 
	- Anyone can run [[an Agora]] of their own if they so desire. This Agora is [[open source]]: [[go/agora]].
  - To [[sign up]] for the Agora, which means volunteering your writing and media to it, please consult [[agora editor]].
  - The Agora wants to be [[maximally inclusive]], but it is in its infancy; it is a [[work in progress]]. If you want to participate and can't, please also send email to signup@anagora.org to let us know. Through projects such as [[agora twitter integration]], we hope to make the Agora available to anyone that has access to a social network account. If you want to learn more about the [[experimental]] nature of this Agora, please refer to [this Hacker News comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25577016). If you want to keep up to date with development, consider adding me on Twitter or Mastodon: [[flancian]].
	- This [[agora]] is in [[social media]].

- Agoras are spaces kept by communities with [[good intent]] while expressing explicit [[goals]] and open [[protocols]]. 
	- This section, made up of items in a [[markdown]] list, is an example of an Agora protocol. 
	- This [[agora protocol]] is a set of simple conventions on top of [[plain text]] or other [[supported formats]].
