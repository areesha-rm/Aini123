- Notes on how to get an Agora up an running on [[podman]] (should work also for [[docker]] with some modifications?).
	- #pull [[podman]]
	- These notes track an [[experiment]] in [[hypatia]], one of the [[servers]] of [[flancia collective]].
  - [[Dockerfile]].

Loosely structured thoughts: it'd be nice if you could just pass a sources.yaml (or a link to an Agora repo?) to some variation of `podman run` and get an Agora, just like that.

Perhaps we need `agora.yaml` though? For things like configuring hostname. [[agora server]] has `config.py`, but it'd be nice to have it be just a config and store it in the [[agora root repository]] instead.
