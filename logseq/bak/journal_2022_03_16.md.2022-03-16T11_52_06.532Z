- I want to prioritize [[agora protocol]] again. The node is a mess, too many ideas jumbled together.
	- Set up [[go/agora-protocol]] to point to the [[google doc]] again; it's the best collaboration artifact we have. Not free, but I think we can be pragmatic.
	- Will try to edit/close down comments. This and another doc had gotten relative traction but I somehow just dropped them from my todo list -- or never got to them. The pandemic and our response at work had to do with it for sure :)
- [[agora]]
	- LATER remove [[logseq]] now/later/done cruft
	- DONE review [[vera]]'s PR for gitlab-based editing
	  :LOGBOOK:
	  CLOCK: [2022-03-16 Wed 10:55:02]--[2022-03-16 Wed 12:08:17] =>  01:13:15
	  :END:
	- LATER experiment again with more eager [[related nodes]], including also suffix matches? or even combinations
		- [[paneer]] should improve because of this :)
	- fix [[pull]] buttons in related nodes/transcluded
