- Back from one week in [[argentina]]!
- [[logseq]]
	- Keeps somehow misplacing/ignoring my settings, in particular surrounding the date format for my journal filenames. Mildly irksome, in particular given that it generates spurious warning messages while at it:
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1644599439384_0.png)
	- LATER find bug report in [[go/logseq/bugs]] or file a new bug
		- I think https://github.com/logseq/logseq/issues/3861 is this.
- [[awesome wiki projects]]
- [[decentralized identifier]]
- I have a backlog of things I should do now that we're back

	- LATER [[autopush]]
		- [[autopush.sh]]
		- add arbitrary triggers for [[push]] behaviour, NOW/LATER being obvious candidates
		- make #push work without [[wikilinks]] and make sure that it works with multiple nodes in arbitrary positions when you do use wikilinks
	- NOW catch up with friends!
