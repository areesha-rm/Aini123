- I brought https://anagora.org down for a bit via backfilling Twitter activity with [[wikilinks]] (mostly mine, but not all) :)
	- [[agora bot]] activity seems to trigger *a lot* of bot activity, and the Agora doesn't currently react very well to spikes of load.
	- LATER Need to prioritize: [[agora sqlite]] [[agora docker]].
- [[worked]] today -- I was a bit tired after not sleeping long enough last night, but it was a productive day anyway. got done most of what I had to do :)
- [[s√§ntis]]
- [[women's vote]]
	- came terribly late to [[switzerland]], in particular some cantons.
	- [[appenzeller innerrhoden]] and appenzeller auserrhoden]]
