	- looking...
	- turns out their bridge somehow lost [[mastodon_access_code]], might need to reauth
- [[meatspace]]
	- DONE will take a walk with [[l]] and [[g]] while the sun's out :)
	- estimated duration: [[2h]]
		- was [[4h]] but amazing
- [[agora]]
	- NOW [[agora matrix bot]] saves message (there's already a todo for this, NOW in [[logseq]] terms)

- [[flancia]], or the [[revolution]] of [[maitreya]]
	- [[let us do loving kindness]]
- [[luciana]] gifted us [[the craft of research]]
- [[twitter dms]]
- #push [[matrix]]
	- [[agora matrix bot]]
		- working on having it write to disk like [[agora twitter bot]] and [[agora mastodon bot]]
		- discussed [[agora api]] with [[vera]] in [[flancia meet]]
		- note that because it is our plan for the [[agora]] to talk [[activitypub]], connecting the [[agora]] to [[matrix rooms]] yields essentially a matrix <-> activitypub bridge, each maybe mapped to an arbitrary node with its [[stoas]].
		- after dinner I'll see if there's already a [[matrix activitypub bridge]] out there :) there probably is, which would means it could be modified to dump activities to disk if it doesn't have that functionality yet. this yields [[agora writing]]. [[agora reading]] can be had by adding 'send once' functionality to [[agora bridge]] or [[agora server]] (probably the earlier)
