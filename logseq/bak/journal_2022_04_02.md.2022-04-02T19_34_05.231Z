- [[spring snow]]
	- it snowed again the last few days, including tonight -- this after a few weeks with 15-20 degrees out. it's happened before; it's surprising still, but less than before.
- [[capra course]]
	- [[lecture 6]]
- [[flancia meet]]
	- thinking of finally setting up [[agora meet]] some other time
	- perhaps [[wednesdays at 5pm gmt]]? that's 09:00 Pacific, so it won't conflict with [[ward]]'s https://wiki.ralfbarkow.ch/view/fedwiki-meet. unfortunately there's a risk I will have conflicts at work, though, at least sometimes.
	- thought of priorities for the upcoming week.
- [[yiming]] == [[ChengduLittleA]]
- [[vegan backerei]]
- [[agora]]
	- [[agora server]]
		- DONE fix [[buddhist orange]]
