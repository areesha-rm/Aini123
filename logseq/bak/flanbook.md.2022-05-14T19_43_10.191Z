		- If it's not, write down a [[plan]] to replicate it.
		- [[Replicate it]] as [[free]] [[open source]].
	- [[People]] can contribute direct work or money.
		- The coordination entity assigns both transparently and openly.
	- [[Net income]] (after expenses related to running the platform) goes to:
		- [[effective altruism]], [[give directly]] and other altruistic and social reform efforts.
		- [[users]] ([[profit sharing]])
