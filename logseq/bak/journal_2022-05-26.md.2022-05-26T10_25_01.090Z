- [[logseq]] is getting slower every day.
    - thinking about starting to use [[wiki vim]] (not [[vim wiki]], confusingly :)) more regularly.
    - #push [[wiki vim]]
        - now I'm writing this in [[wiki vim]], in which:
            - ,ww navigates to index.md
            - ,w,w navigates to the current journal
            - unfortunately navigating to a wikilink from the journal creates the file in journal/, even though I want it in the root.
