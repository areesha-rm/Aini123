- an [[idea]]
	- to add a note-taking/posting function to hypothes.is and other [[web annotation tools]]
	- free annotations are stand-alone posts: they aren't attached at creation time to a particular book, but rather are like posts it one could latter apply
	- could be presumably hacked together by attaching page-scoped documents to "well known" URLs
	- I sorely missed this in [[i annotate 2021]] to directly post links from chat into its [[g]]
