# Foam

- A [[project]].
- [[roam like]]. A [[vscode]] extension.
- As of [[2021-01-04]], my personal [[agora client]].
- [[go]] https://foambubble.github.io/foam/
- By [[jevakallio]].
- Perhaps an alternative to Roam. The VSCode platform is... weird? But promising.
- Notable contributors / people I've met in the [[discord]]: [[ingalless]] [[scottjoe]] [[riccardo]] [[mathieudutour]].
