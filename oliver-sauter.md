- Greetings!
- [[bluetooth codecs]]
- [[hypothes.is]] and [[memex]]
- [[memex search]]
- [[interop]] for [[roam likes]] and other [[tools]] in the [[pkm]] [[market]]
  - [[oliver]] how do we figure this out at least on the level of addressing each other's blocks?
  - [[flancian]] idea:
    - base protocol, extensible with contracts
  - [[oliver]] standardization is tricky from the perspective that you need to get everybody onboard -- including the organizations producing these tools.
  - [[flancian]] two pronged approach in the [[agora]]:
    - [[wikilinks everywhere]]
    - [[actions]]
- [[cloud infrastructure]] is the focus now
  - After this is done, we'll focus on [[apis]] and [[integrations]]
- [[roam]] does not require in its default data model to do any form of standardization. If you're a [[roam]] user and you use [[roam.js]], you can interpret any response as a block.
  - the main difference between [[memex]] and [[roam]]: [[roam]] is a [[synthesizing]] tool. [[memex]] is a [[collector]] or [[curation]] [[tool]].
