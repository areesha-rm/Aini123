- Greetings!
- [[bluetooth codecs]]
- [[hypothes.is]] and [[memex]]
- [[memex search]]
- [[interop]] for [[roam likes]] and other [[tools]] in the [[pkm]] [[market]]
  - [[oliver]] how do we figure this out at least on the level of addressing each other's blocks?
  - [[flancian]] idea:
    - base protocol, extensible with contracts
  - [[oliver]] standardization is tricky from the perspective that you need to get everybody onboard -- including the organizations producing these tools.
  - [[flancian]] two pronged approach in the [[agora]]:
    - [[wikilinks everywhere]]
      - [[oliver]] syntax wise they are great -- all tools support them.
      - [[oliver]] the problem with the syntax is that it's not web 2.0 compatible. It requires a shared knowledge about each other's infra.
        - [[agora protocol]] could be a [[library]].
    - [[actions]]
- [[cloud infrastructure]] is the focus now
  - After this is done, we'll focus on [[apis]] and [[integrations]]
- [[roam]] does not require in its default data model to do any form of standardization. If you're a [[roam]] user and you use [[roam.js]], you can interpret any response as a block.
  - the main difference between [[memex]] and [[roam]]: [[roam]] is a [[synthesizing]] tool. [[memex]] is a [[collector]] or [[curation]] [[tool]].
- What are the [[memex]] [[user journeys]]? Perhaps in particular in comparison with [[hypothes.is]].
  - [[oliver]]:
    - [[hypothes.is]] excels in academic research and academic annotations.
    - [[memex]] and [[hypothes.is]] will eventually [[interop]].
    - [[memex]] tries to bridge the gap between [[discovery]] and [[curation]]/[[organization]].
    - If you think of [[twitter]], the only way you can organize content is to use [[bookmarks]].
    - [[memex]] lets you curate collections of content, annotate them individually or collectively, and integrate them into [[synthesis workflows]] like those in [[roam]].
- [[oliver]] advantage of [[agora]] ([[hub]]) approach: cheaper integrations.
  - [[oliver]] ongoing maintenance cost 
  - [[flancian]] another downside: [[SPOF]]
  - [[oliver]] to make anagora.org really work, everybody needs to be onboard
  - [[oliver]] [[memex]] can do multi-content: that means users can capture/curate/annotate content of many types
    - ([[raindrop]] and [[are.na]] do that too)
