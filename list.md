# list

- a [[thing]].
	- I like [[lists]]. I keep some in the [[agora]], often very incomplete.
		- They are usually plurals for the item. The list of items of type [[list]] is [[lists]].
		- As of [[2021-08-07]] I have not implemented this, but I plan to make it so that if you use [[agora protocol]] you can mention the type of a node (e.g. 'a thing' in this page) and it will cause it to be auto-appended as an item to the list of the matching plural (e.g. 'things').
		- For now you can just push/pull items to/from lists.
		- [[wikipedia]] has a great many great [[lists]]. I find them very interesting and I'd like to include more of them in the [[agora]].
	- [[do]] is a list of sorts.
		- [[push]] [[do]]
			- [[auto pull]]
