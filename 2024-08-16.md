- I got here the long way around :)
  - For sure I did! Cool -- back here something like... 18 hours later, at 22.
  - Yesterday night I had a wild ride restoring my preferred [[Agora editor]] to working order, and then exorcising my digital garden from a file over 100MB which I accidentally committed and made Github refuse me all service with insufficient explanation :)
    - I had to do a [[git rebase]], which didn't work, and (re-) learn about [[git filter-repo]] and such
- [[Silverbullet]]:
  - Now running [[Silverbullet dev]] having worked around the actual trigger for the most critical part of https://github.com/silverbulletmd/silverbullet/issues/1010, which ended up being not due to garden scale only but also due to a recent change I had made to my config :)
    - Keeping an eye on the other performance issues.
    - You wouldn't believe how much I missed having a web-based [[Agora editor]].
    - It made me think I still have to keep honest and actually offer this as a service in the [[Agora of Flancia]] -- I would love to provide hosted Silverbullet for whoever wants it.
  - Thought of:
    - [[Agora demo]]
    - [[AG]]
