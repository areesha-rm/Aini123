- I got here the long way around :)
- [[Silverbullet]]:
  - Now running [[Silverbullet dev]] having worked around the actual trigger for the most critical part of https://github.com/silverbulletmd/silverbullet/issues/1010, which ended up being not due to garden scale only but also due to a recent change I had made to my config :)
    - Keeping an eye on the other performance issues.
    - You wouldn't believe how much I missed having a web-based [[Agora editor]].
    - It made me think I still have to keep honest and actually offer this as a service in the [[Agora of Flancia]] -- I would love to provide hosted Silverbullet for whoever wants it.
  - Thought of:
    - [[Agora demo]]
    - [[AG]]
