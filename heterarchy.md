  - Elements of the organization are [[unranked]] (non-hierarchical) -- or possess the potential to be ranked a number of different ways.
  - "The concept of heterarchy was first employed in a modern context by Warren McCulloch in 1945. As Carole L. Crumley has summarised, "[h]e examined alternative cognitive structure(s), the collective organization of which he termed heterarchy. He demonstrated that the human [[brain]], while reasonably orderly was not organized hierarchically. This understanding revolutionized the neural study of the brain and solved major problems in the fields of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[computer design]]."
