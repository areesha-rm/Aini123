## [[2023-04-16]]

Writing this on the plane before taking off from ZRH. I'll have a stopover in Toronto before travelling on to Seattle, where I will stay until next Sunday 2023-04-23.

I plan to use some of the time to work; I'm way behind on summit preparation and I hope to catch up a bit. But I will also try to just enjoy the flight generally.

I ended up reading two chapters of a book, reviewing three documents and sleeping about 1h in the first flight. Not bad! Now about to take off from Toronto. I feel like I will crash soon but I'll try to keep going.
