Writing this on the plane before taking off from ZRH. I'll have a stopover in Toronto before travelling on to Seattle, where I will stay until next Sunday 2023-04-23.

I plan to use some of the time to work; I'm way behind on summit preparation and I hope to catch up a bit. But I will also try to just enjoy the flight generally.

I ended up reading two chapters of a book, reviewing three documents and sleeping about 1h in the first flight. Not bad! Now about to take off from Toronto. I feel like I will crash soon but I'll try to keep going.

As half-expected I ended up not writing much during the trip. Usually one thing leads to another and I try to focus on being present, in particular around friends and other people I like, instead of writing in the Agora. Remaining connected with friends back home is also a priority, as it was in this case.

Overall I'm happy with the result of the trip, and also definitely happy about going back home. The summit went well, and meeting people face to face is always interesting and remains important w.r.t. being able to effectively work on present projects and generate ideas for new ones.

During the trip I referred to my visit often as my [[farewell tour]], half in jest -- but with some degree of truth. I don't know what will happen, but thinking about it in [[multiverse]] terms (my default framing as of the time of writing) I'd wager that in a significant number of timelines this was indeed my last US visit. In this one (which one?) maybe I will be back to the US as early as next month, although in that occasion to the east coast. In this one (which one?) maybe I will be back to the west coast again by the end of the year, or more likely in [[2024]], in particular if I'm still employed by Google by then and the company has returned to a more "reasonable" (from my point of view, and that of many others) travel policy.
