# 2023-04-16

Writing this on the plane before taking off from ZRH. I'll have a stopover in Toronto before travelling on to Seattle, where I will stay until next Sunday 2023-04-23.

I plan to use some of the time to work; I'm way behind on summit preparation and I hope to catch up a bit. But I will also try to just enjoy the flight generally.
