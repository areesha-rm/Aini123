	- found himself reading in a less analytical way
	- [[armengol]]
		- the structure itself seems to encourage this
		- "I need to read it fast" yields a different kind of reading too, perhaps
	- [[lorand]] some pieces seem to be a bit rough. but interesting questions
		- the observation that people feel calm in nature -> homogeneity in aesthetics
		- ad hoc/rushed at the end: processes for using patterns for differentiation of space. differentiation vs accumulation
		- some vagueness
	- a bit tragic perhaps: towards the end, neighbors working together to make their houses beautiful. seemed a bit utopian in a modernist sense.
- a [[pattern]] has a [[context]], a [[problem]] and a [[solution]] that resolves the set of conflicting forces.
- embodiment as crucial vs the software patterns
