# Reading Alexander

- I read what we agreed to read :)
	- [[patterns]]
	- [[pattern chosen]]
- proposal: design a space following the example in the introductory material? 10-20 patterns combined.
	- [[xxxv]] for example
	- [[xxxviii]] for [[procedure]]
	- [[code]] a generator?
		- fit between patterns seems represented by recommended patterns at higher and lower level?
	- [[armengol]] some problems perhaps
		- we need to imagine a need for building something? what would be the context for the exercise?
- [[andreas]]
	- would probably recommend people just go to [[a pattern language]] directly, it seems to be self-contained
	- did something with [[a pattern language]] ~1y ago
	- it just seems like previous reading wouldn't help learning how to write your own patterns?
		- [[jonathan]] what would you recommend?
		- the ideological component sometimes doesn't resonate; the patterns themselves, which can be used and changed regardless of ideology, seem more generally useful.
	- [[simon]] this is framed as one big project (the three books). what's interesting: there is some goal of trying to provide a set of tools to shape one's environment.
		- [[notsof]] could almost be computed by a machine
		- whereas [[apl]] is very much grounded
			- [[abstract]] -> [[concrete]]
		- topic: what is [[timeless]] and [[beautiful]]. how the environment shapes us as much as we shape the environment.
		- the weakest patterns are the strongly [[utilitarian]]. the stronger ones are "spiritual"
		- some contradictions between patterns
			- he loves dense cities and lively areas
			- but he wants height limits and only building on 50% of the area
		- units per building
		- in a contemporary context a lot of the patterns are very difficult to achieve
		- aside: would be interesting to model fit/misfit between patterns even as we swap in/out some of them
	- pattern: [[filtered light]]
		- mentions how the perception of light gets softened if it's filtered; less high contrast, which is a nice quality. for living spaces softness is nice.
		- film makers think it makes objects more lively: e.g. leaves casting moving shadows.
		- third reason: speculative. stimulates us biologically (?)
			- could be socialized aesthetics instead.
		- when planning windows, this pattern is recommended.
- [[armengol]]
	- pattern: [[window place]]
	- [[q]] when trying to differentiate between the list of patterns 
- [[jonathan]]
	- [[four stories limit]]
		- ideology aside: main thing that bothered me in general. trying to justify things as [[natural]].
		- "want to find a pattern that looks ridiculous"
		- in zurich: like [[hardau]] towers 
		- some justification for this pattern has to do with mental health issues
		- people who live in high rises are less likely to go out into the world
			- [[sky bridges]]
		- feeling connected to the city life
		- [[andreas]] it seems very opinionated, it depends on one's preferences. you might not care about the misfits and have fits with your lifestyle.
		- [[simon]] four floors doesn't seem high density enough for city life. attitude towards skyrises changes a lot across cultures. singapore for example has a very different disposition towards them.
			- most sustainable density is about six floors.
			- the most antisocial aspect of high rises is to have parking-lot-to-living-floor.
			- isolation in high rises is a big problem though.

	- [[bus stop]]
- [[alice]]
	- [[interior windows]]
- [[eduardo]]
	- [[independent regions]]

- [[ttwob]]
- [[lorand]]
	- found himself reading in a less analytical way
	- [[armengol]]
		- the structure itself seems to encourage this
		- "I need to read it fast" yields a different kind of reading too, perhaps
	- [[lorand]] some pieces seem to be a bit rough. but interesting questions
		- the observation that people feel calm in nature -> homogeneity in aesthetics
		- ad hoc/rushed at the end: processes for using patterns for differentiation of space. differentiation vs accumulation
		- some vagueness
	- a bit tragic perhaps: towards the end, neighbors working together to make their houses beautiful. seemed a bit utopian in a modernist sense.
- a [[pattern]] has a [[context]], a [[problem]] and a [[solution]] that resolves the set of conflicting forces.
- embodiment as crucial vs the software patterns
- [[kowloon walled city]]
- [[tokyo 1960]]
- [[wabi sabi]]
