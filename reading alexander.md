- I read what we agreed to read :)
	- [[patterns]]
	- [[pattern chosen]]
- proposal: design a space following the example in the introductory material? 10-20 patterns combined.
	- [[xxxv]] for example
	- [[xxxviii]] for [[procedure]]
	- [[code]] a generator?
		- fit between patterns seems represented by recommended patterns at higher and lower level?
	- [[armengol]] some problems perhaps
		- we need to imagine a need for building something? what would be the context for the exercise?
- [[andras]]
	- pattern: [[filtered light]]
	- would probably recommend people just go to [[a pattern language]] directly, it seems to be self-contained
	- did something with [[a pattern language]] ~1y ago
	- it just seems like previous reading wouldn't help learning how to write your own patterns?
		- [[jonathan]] what would you recommend?
		- the ideological component sometimes doesn't resonate; the patterns themselves, which can be used and changed regardless of ideology, seem more generally useful.
	- [[simon]] this is framed as one big project (the three books). what's interesting: there is some goal of trying to provide a set of tools to shape one's environment.
- [[armengol]]
	- pattern:

	- found himself reading in a less analytical way
	- [[armengol]]
		- the structure itself seems to encourage this
		- "I need to read it fast" yields a different kind of reading too, perhaps
	- [[lorand]] some pieces seem to be a bit rough. but interesting questions
		- the observation that people feel calm in nature -> homogeneity in aesthetics
		- ad hoc/rushed at the end: processes for using patterns for differentiation of space. differentiation vs accumulation
		- some vagueness
	- a bit tragic perhaps: towards the end, neighbors working together to make their houses beautiful. seemed a bit utopian in a modernist sense.
- a [[pattern]] has a [[context]], a [[problem]] and a [[solution]] that resolves the set of conflicting forces.
- embodiment as crucial vs the software patterns
- [[kowloon walled city]]
- [[tokyo 1960]]
- [[wabi sabi]]
- [[lorand]]
