# Fascism

- Perhaps the one group that is not allowed into [[Flancia]]?
  - A [[flancian]] says: we are only against people that enforce their will on others violently as an expression of intolerance; we don't do it, and if you don't do it either we have no beef with you violently and as an expression of intolerance"
  - Feedback: It is powerful to be able to say "this is all fully optional and you can ignore it if you don't like it, it's written in our [[manifesto]]"
