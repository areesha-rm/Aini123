# Wiki

- a [[thing]].
  - [[pull]] [[wikis]]
- A [[technology]].
	- [[digital]] [[social]]
	- discovered by [[ward cunningham]].
	- the [[agora]] tries to be a kind of best-effort integrated [[wiki]].
		- in my mind it leads to a [[democratic]] [[distributed knowledge graph]].
			- like [[ewp]] with a focus on [[praxis]].
			- like [[flancia]]!
