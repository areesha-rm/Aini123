# Wiki

- A [[great invention]].
- By [[ward-cunningham]].
  - I met [[ward-cunningham]] through [[dan whaley]] and the [[social-knowledge-graph]] group. I'm kind of stoked about it :)
- The [[Agora]] hopes to be a "new" kind of [[wiki]].
  - In my mind it could be essentially [[ewp]]] as a [[democratic]] [[distributed knowledge graph]].
