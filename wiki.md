# Wiki

- A [[great invention]].
- By [[ward-cunningham]].
  - I met [[ward-cunningham]]. I'm kind of stoked about it. I think they are a great [[person]].
- The [[Agora]] hopes to be a "new" kind of [[wiki]].
  - In my mind it could be essentially [[ewp]]] as a [[democratic]] [[distributed knowledge graph]].
