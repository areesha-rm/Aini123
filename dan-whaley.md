### Agenda
- [[wikilinks everywhere]]
  - Clients
  - Use cases
  - [[browser-extension]]
- Next steps for interop/protocol -- different from the above? Convergent?
- Out there question

### Notes
- 22 people now in the company!
- Raising money
- [[Skunk works]]
- Youtube annotator
  - [[docdrop]]
  - What about integrating this into the [[agora]]?
- [[athens]] story 
  - joined the beta 
  - great for single-user use cases
  - but doesn't go after collaboration, publishing, web
- [[fedwiki]] seems to be the closest thing to the agora
  - check out the wednesday calls 
- [[react]] (a module) could be another frontend to the agora
  - [[review]] [[preact]] is the new kind
- would love to experiment to [[hypothes.is]]
  - [[hypagora]]: a fork/branch
- [[underlay]]
  - seemed like it was more about structured representation
  - agora is more like [[folksonomy]]

### Questions
- Journey to understand the broad frame.
  - There is a movement in humanity towards networked thinking.
  - The book -> the telephone -> the web.
  - What's next? There's another step coming. The beginning of truly coordinated semantic thinking.
  - Dan believes that the note taking paradigm with wiki links is a key part of this journey but it needs an ingredient.
    - Standards.
    - Open coordination.
    - Federation.
  - Annotation is the *edge*. An event horizon.
    - The ability to coordinate between clients that live at the edge is key.
    - Does not yet have the power of the wiki link.
  - Notion/Roam are not yet unlocking the full human potential.
    - Dan is on a journey to find what are the essential components.
  - Open questions: groups, groups permissions.
  - Hypothesis gets tweeted at by people who are using their tools in new ways.
 - John Gilmore.
   - Local cyberpunk guy, founder of Sun Microsystems.
   - Lots of different annotation services; how do you know which annotation services have annotations with a page?
   - Similar problem to go link authorities.
   - DHT.
 - Del.ic.ious. 

### Backlinks
 - Some people think that the fact that backlinks were absent in the original web was part of what let it grow.

### Risks
- What if in the future you can't just run a server in your closet?
- W3C
  - Hypothes.is is part of it
  - [[Tim Berners Lee]] holds it together.
  - Community group -> working group
  - [[Ivan Herman]]
    - Senior staff at W3C
  - Community group is outside the W3C, but blessed. Build a community, clear plan. Then you're invited to a working group.
- Browser vendors consortium (name?)
  - Conveniently outside the W3C.

### Todo
- [[Annotation standard]]: read it
  - Data model
    - JSON/RDF: elements that needs to make up an annotation
  - Protocol
    - Rest
  - Vocabulary
    - What are the concepts in this space.

### One idea
- A discrete component.
- Glorified markdown editors.
- Hypothes.is -> readwise -> Roam
  -  Hypothes.is as a SGK client
  -  Standards compliant wiki service

### Social Networks

- Dan agrees that most of the activity is socially beneficial.
- People still think of these networks as being apart from themselves. But the network is the organism.

### Topics
- Tagging.
  - [[Everything2]].com.
- Open source versions of projects.
  - Athens.
  - Truly networked paradigm?
- Loose coupling / loose integration.
- My view: personal gardens are what get a critical mass. It needs to be independent.
