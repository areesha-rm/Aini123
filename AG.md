- a [[person]].
  - my [[love]]
  - also [[friend]].
  - We met on the 30th of March, went to [[Xenix]] and [[Ikoo]], exchanged numbers on the 31st.
  - We had tea on the [[2nd of April]].

We met as we were nearing the 0th of April and it was meeting beauty from the start.

We travelled apart for three weeks in the first six weeks, but we kept in touch and longed for each other, I am fine asserting, although I have direct experience only of my longing for her.

I went to the May 1st activities thanks to her. Around the third week of May I feel we are happier than ever before.
