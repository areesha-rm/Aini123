- [[work]] was OK.
  - tomorrow will be even better I think :)
  - it will start weirdly.
- I thought of [[tanzwerk]] and [[hardturm]] again, and of cycling through the city, thanks to the Agora/my digital garden. Maybe during the weekend?
- While using the Agora, I thought of some things:
  - It is a shame that so few different users show up in recent, BUT there are a few contributors I didn't know about and that felt cool/interesting and I found several nodes by old friends I want to read.
  - It really should have a 'pin' or 'star' or 'save' button as "mvp" for storing state originating from the web client but not tied to an editor. I found some wikipedia-articles-within-the-Agora that I wanted to 'pin' as having been interesting, and just being able to save a subnode that says 'flancian was here on X' would suffice really. Like a visitors log, old web style maybe. Or just a bit in sqlite?
