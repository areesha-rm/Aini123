# Agora Editor

- In essence, all you really need to use the [[Agora]] is the capability to make Markdown (or just text, really) files publicly available somewhere. I use [[foam]] to produce and manage my notes, and [[git]] to store them online.
- As of [[2021-01-03]], the recommended Agora editor is [[foam]].
  - [[foam]] is a [[vscode]] [[extension]].
  - If those worlds make sense to you, congratulations :) You can use the [[Agora]].
  - If they don't, please reach out. I want to make the [[Agora]] [[maximally inclusive]].
  - Please refer to [[agora install]] for more detailed instructions.
- You can also use:
  - [[dendron]], which should be a drop-in [[foam]] replacement in [[vscode]].
  - [[obsidian]], which doesn't depend on [[vscode]] -- but you need to manage pushing to [[git]] on your own.
  - [[roam]] plus [[roam2agora]]
- Or you can reach out :) Send email (I know, how quaint!) to signup@anagora.org, or DM [[flancian]] on Twitter, Mastodon, or any other platform.
