# Agora Editor

- As of [[2020-12-29]], [[foam]].
  - [[foam]] is a [[vscode]] [[extension]].
  - If those worlds make sense to you, congratulations :) You can use the [[Agora]].
  - If they don't, please reach out. I want to make the [[Agora]] all [[inclusive]].
- You can also use [[obsidian]] and manage backup to [[git]] on your own.
- Or you can reach out :) Send email (I know, how quaint!) to 0@flancia.org.
