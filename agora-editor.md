# Agora Editor

- As of [[2020-12-29]], the recommended Agora editor is [[foam]].
  - [[foam]] is a [[vscode]] [[extension]].
  - If those worlds make sense to you, congratulations :) You can use the [[Agora]].
  - If they don't, please reach out. I want to make the [[Agora]] [[maximally inclusive]].
  - You can also use [[obsidian]] and manage backups to [[git]] on your own.
- In essence, all you really need to use the [[Agora]] is the capability to make Markdown (or just text, really) files publicly available somewhere. I use [[git]].
  - [[the agora is a markdown convention]]
  - [[pull]] [[agora install]]
- Or you can reach out :) Send email (I know, how quaint!) to signup@anagora.org, or DM [[flancian]] on Twitter, Mastodon, or any other platform.
