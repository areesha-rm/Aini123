[[Ocell]] is back and it makes me happy: https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1411357189097328648. She came back worse for wear (shaved in four spots, with the right eye a bit twitchy/as if irritated by something that happened during the night). But after spending several hours cleaning herself and relaxing she already looked happier. Then she decided to call it a night early and go to her favourite deep night spot at like 5pm, ha. I think she'll wake up refreshed and rejuvenated in the morning!
