- [[work]] happened, ups and downs, I was a bit tired; I think I should go to bed earlier on Mondays as Tuesdays demand energy :)
- [[nostromo]] crashed again and then exhibited a [[heisenbug]] (I wrote about it on Fedi).
  - it's pretty out there how much time I've been spending trying to keep nostromo alive -- it crashes quite often, I should prioritize that
  - [ ] [[backup nostromo]]
  - then maybe I could get a replacement, or just use it to the end but try to work around the issues with more automation? because they're hardware triggered (overheating, plus some likely adapter related issues for what is a laptop with many functions)
- some [[social.coop]] work, it made me a bit sad to revert an experiment that I thought could be positive due to spirited pushback but it's important to respect the feedback of the community
- thought about:
  - [[forking]]
  - [[merging]]
- [[bangers]]
- [[silverbullet bug]] which makes it harder for me to write in the Agora :(
  - but things will hopefully get better :)
