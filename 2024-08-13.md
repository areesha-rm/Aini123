- [[work]] happened
- [[nostromo]] crashed again and then exhibited a [[heisenbug]] (I wrote about it on Fedi).
- some [[social.coop]] work, it made me a bit sad to revert an experiment that I thought could be positive due to spirited pushback but it's important to respect the experience of the community
- thought about:
  - [[forking]]
  - [[merging]]
- [[banger]]
- [[silverbullet bug]] makes it harder for me to write in the Agora :(
  - but things will get better :)
