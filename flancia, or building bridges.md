# Flancia, or building bridges

There is a [[bridge]] from the [[Agora]] to [[Flancia]], in the same way that there is a pot of gold at the other end of the rainbow -- or whichever way it is the saying goes.

There is a bridge from Flancia to the Agora as well -- that much is obvious, as it's through Flancia that I got to the Agora. It isn't as clear whether the bridge is the same or different; I think that depends on each person's experience. Some people get to Flancia first, some get to the Agora; between them there are, perhaps, infinite variations on the same bridge pattern.
