- [[October 2023]]
  - [[23]]: We arrived in [[Tokyo]] as the sun was setting after a long but pleasant journey; we had a short layover in [[Hong Kong]]. We stayed in [[Shinjuku]], had sushi around midnight in a place that closes at 5am (!) and is also good.
  - [[24]]: Shibuya.
  - [[25]]: Asakusa, Akihabara, then went up to a very tall building. 
  - [[26]]: Took the train to Hakone. We stayed in a beautiful old school hotel, [[Fujiya]]. We went to the [[Onsen]] both days.
  - [[27]]: Took the bus to the lake and walked alongside it. We visited a [[Shinto]] shrine and had dinner next to the train station.
  - [[28]]: Travelled to Kyoto in the [[Shinkansen]]. We went to the park at night.
  - [[29]]: Went to the Shinto shrine up at the top of a local mountain.
  - [[30]]: Bought tea, visited the gardens of the emperor's palace. Then wandered in a relatively dead neighborhood. Then went to a Buddhist temple that was opened by night and visited its bamboo grove.
