- a [[phrase]].
  - #pull [[jaras]].
  - this Spanish language phrase could be translated in several ways:
  - "the arrows (or darts) of Adam..."
    - "where they land, they land" (they fall by chance)
    - "where they land, they hit" (where they hit, they do damage)
    - "where they hit, they give" (in an altruistic way, a stretch but I like it)
