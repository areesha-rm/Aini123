# 2020-11-17

- [[2020-11-16]] was productive! I'm glad.
- Tested [[roam2agora]]. Works great! Two possible improvements:
  - Always print the number of pages processes and pages selected for publication.
  - Add a flag to default to public.
- [x] Remind [[s5bug]] about https://twitter.com/s5bug/status/1328475640954200066
- [[twitter agora integration]]: auto convert tweets to embeds
- [[roam2agora]] perhaps could use https://twitter.com/RoamResearch/status/1236142937051762688

## Planned
- [[agora plan]] after 19.30.
- Perhaps work on making it easier for people using [[roam2agora]] to submit their gardens to the Agora.
- Perhaps work on auto-embedding tweets, see [[agora twitter integration]].
- Sync flancia.org go links setup -> anagora.org, thus bootstrapping anagora.org go links.
