It was in Antiflancia that I knew [[Moloch]]: I saw his true face in the corrupt beauty of those that ignored suffering even as it stared back; I saw them took shape in the rich that learnt (were raised) not to stray near the wrong places -- the places of suffering.

The capital of Antiflancia is beautiful; they call it [[Omelas]].
