  It was in [[Antiflancia]] that I knew [[Moloch]]: I saw his true face in the corrupt beauty of those that ignored suffering even as it stared them back; I saw the [[egregore]] take shape from the bodies of the rich as they learnt (were raised, then taught) not to stray near the wrong places -- the places where suffering in hidden in plain view.
  
  The capital of [[Antiflancia]] is not ugly, as you might expect, but rather beautiful; they call it [[Omelas]].
