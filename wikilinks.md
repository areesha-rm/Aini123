# Wikilinks

- a [[thing]].
	- [[pull]] [[wikilink]]
		- I'm excited about [[wikilinks everywhere]].
	- [[alternate names]]
		- [[vera]] suggested we rename these. Some brainstorming follows
			- [[multilinks]]: as they are unlike regular links in that they can point to many different places -- which particular URL they resolve to depends on the user clicking them.
			- [[querylinks]] ([[qlinks]]?): as they essentially behave as queries in the agora. queries return relevant subnodes/resources.
			- [[nodelinks]] as they map to nodes in the agora.
				- [[edges]]?
		- [[neil]] [[hyphalinks]]
