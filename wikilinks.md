# Wikilinks

- [[pull]] [[wikilink]]
	- I'm excited about [[wikilinks everywhere]].
- [[alternate names]]
	- [[vera]] suggested we rename these. Some brainstorming follows
		- [[multilinks]]: as they are unlike regular links in that they can point to many different places -- which particular URL they resolve to depends on the user clicking them.
		- [[querylinks]]: as they essentially behave as queries in the agora. queries return relevant subnodes/resources.
