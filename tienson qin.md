## [[2021-07-04]]
- huge fan!
- what does [[logseq]] need/how are you doing?
	- five people
		- [[tienson qin]] is in [[hangzhou]]
		- met [[junyu zhan]] as well
	- funding from friends
	- [[note taking]] app, but in the future would like to develop a [[platform]] to exchange knowledge
	- vision: [[open knowledge]] and [[free knowledge]] for everyone
- why [[logseq]] was written
	- worked for [[streamlabs]]
	- been doing [[clojure]] for 10y (!)
		- started with php many years ago :)
		- completely rewrote in clojure
	- was personally using [[org mode]] and [[tiddlywiki]]
		- q: how difficult it is to support logseq with both org mode and markdown?
		- not very hard as they both get converted to [[datascript]]
- q: do you plan to go beyond [[outliner]] mode?
	- fan of [[whimsical]], but commercial/not open source
	- want to have different modes, not only outliner
- q: are you interested in cross-platform login/signup
	- [[fission]] and [[deta]]
- q: how should platforms integrate with logseq?
		
## Example of free form section
This would be an example of a non-outliner section.
