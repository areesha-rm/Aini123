# Matrix

- a [[tool]].
  - [[federated]] [[chat]] [[network]].
    - successor to [[xmpp]] -- or that is the pitch.
		- reasonable web and android versions; supports voice messages well, video calls in the works.
  - [[element]] is my default client.
    - #go https://app.element.io
	- I'm on [[matrix]]: @flancian@matrix.org
		- (see [[flancian]] for my identities in other platforms)
		- there are [[agora]] [[rooms]] in matrix, each room implicitly a space for collaboration and cooperation -- or a [[stoa]]:
			- [[flancia collective]]
      - [[agora discuss]]
      - [[agora development]]
      - [[fedstoa]]
      - [[wikilinks everywhere]]
      - [[promnesia]]
    - [[list of matrix servers]]
