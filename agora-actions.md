# Agora Actions

- The agora can trigger actions in the context of a node when said node includes a block with a [[wikilink]] to a known [[action]]. 
- Currently supported actions are:
  - *go*, which makes anagora.org/go/<node> redirect to the url appearing after the action.
    - Example that works in this page: [[go]] https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1329890862499770368
  - *pull*, which transcludes a target node into the current context (good for synonyms and related content).
    - [[pull]] [[action]]
    - [[pull]] [[agora action]]
    - (see below for effect)
  - *push*, which transcludes the current *block* and any children to the target node. 
    - [[push]] [[2021-01-25]] I documented push in [[agora actions]] today.
      - See [[2021-01-25]] for effect.
- See also:
  - [[push and pull]] for interactions between those two actions.
  - [[agora plan]] for plans on further actions.
