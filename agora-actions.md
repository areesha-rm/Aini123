# Agora Actions

- The agora can trigger actions in the context of a node when said node includes a block with a reference to a known [[action]]. 
- Currently supported actions are:
  - *go*, which makes anagora.org/go/<node> redirect to the url appearing after the action.
    - Example that works in this page: [[go]] https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1329890862499770368
  - *pull*, which transcludes a target node into the current context (good for synonims and related content).
    - Example that works in this page: [[pull]] [[action]]
- See also:
  - [[agora plan]].
  - [[agora go links integration]]
  - [[agora-twitter-integration]]
