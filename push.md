- An [[action]].
	- It 'means' that a certain context is relevant for the target node and should perhaps be included in it ([[transclusion]]):
	  - [[push]] [[transclusion]]
	- Here's how you use it: you start a block with the [[push]] action, passing a target node as an argument. Then you attach as many sub blocks (indented list items) to the block; they will be included in the target as a subnode.
	- [[push]] [[agora twitter integration]]
		- Push probably has good interactions with [[twitter]] and the [[fediverse]].
		- If you tell an [[agora]] to [[push]] and you are a [[friend]], it'll push with you.
- See also: [[pull]].
