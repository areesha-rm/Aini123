# Push

- An [[action]].
- It 'means' that a certain context is relevant for the target node and should perhaps be included in it ([[transclusion]]):
  - [[push]] [[transclusion]]
- Here's how you use it: you start a block with the [[push]] action, passing a target node as an argument. Then you attach as many sub blocks (indented list items) to the block; they will be included in the target as a subnode.
- [[push]] [[agora twitter integration]]
  - Push probably has good interactions with other [[agora]] sources such as [[twitter]].
- See also: [[pull]].
