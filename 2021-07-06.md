Went to the office again after like eight months, and only for the second time since February 2020; we had a team day with social distancing/lots of time in the terrace. It was nice seeing others, and also a bit weird/freaky at first. I had forgotten how it felt to be around more than 2-3 people at a time, and how it felt to see some of my coworkers specifically -- some of whom I've worked with for almost 8 years.
