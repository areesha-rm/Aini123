- [[pernambuco e seu conjunto]]
- [[flancia]]
- [[firefox]] [[nightly]] turned out to be a bit too bleeding edge for me
	- [[bugs]]
		- can't get logins to stick in at least two sites: [[discord]] and [[google]] (!). the last one is a bit of a dealbreaker for me.
		- this happens even at 'standard' level of tracking protection, which is supposed not to break anything -- so perhaps unrelated to that.
		- I searched in bugzilla and didn't find anything yet.
		- I do intend to file this bug, but have reverted to stable [[firefox]] for now to unblock other work.
		- [[sidebery]] made porting my tabs from one to the other super easy (it has a snapshot feature)
