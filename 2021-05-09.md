    - can't get logins to stick in at least two sites: [[discord]] and [[google]] (!). the last one is a bit of a dealbreaker for me.
    - this happens even at 'standard' level of tracking protection, which is supposed not to break anything -- so perhaps unrelated to that.
    - I searched in bugzilla and didn't find anything yet.
    - I do intend to file this bug, but have reverted to stable [[firefox]] for now to unblock other work.
    - [[sidebery]] made porting my tabs from one to the other super easy (it has a snapshot feature)

  - make [[obsidian]] attachments work in the [[agora]], they look super handy
    - like this: ![[Pasted image 20210509183555.png]]
  - make dev.anagora.org have proper logging
    - fix config.py mess, copy what [[moa]] does likely
  - remove [[foam]] cruft from my garden: [[defoam]]
