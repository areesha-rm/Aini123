- An [[essay]].
  - I [[love]] lights.
    - #pull [[light]]
  - I like making them my meditation object, after reaching access concentration through focus on the breath or some other means.
    - One can always ask oneself: where are lights around us? And look for them in your visual field.
  - My experience after practicing this is that there are usually more lights than I usually think around me at any given time.
