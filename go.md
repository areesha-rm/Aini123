# Go

- An [[action]].
- See also: [[go link]].
- See also: [[agora-go-links-integration]].
- [[go]] flancia.org/mine/go-links
  - The above block results in the Agora creating a [[go link]] for the node id in which it is in ('go'), redirecting to the URL that appears after the action.
  - Concretely, if you visit anagora.org/go/go you will be redirected to flancia.org/mine/go-links.
  - This, I believe, can be a sufficient substrate for implementing [[social bookmarking]] and [[social search]].
