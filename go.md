# Go

- An [[action]].
  - A [[go link]] is a [[canonical result]] for a [[search query]].
  - A [[go link]] is a [[url]] which is [[relevant]] for the task at hand.
  - If the [[agora]] sees a block in your notes that links to the 'go' node followed by a [[URL]], as per the example below, it will redirect users to the URL when they invoke the action.
  - See also: [[agora-go-links-integration]].
- *To browse every [[go link]] in the [[agora]], see [[backlinks]] below.*
- [[go]] flancia.org/mine/go-links
  - The above block results in the Agora creating a [[go link]] for the node id in which it is in ('go'), redirecting to the URL that appears after the action.
  - Concretely, if you visit anagora.org/go/go you will be redirected to flancia.org/mine/go-links.
  - This, I believe, can be a sufficient substrate for implementing [[social bookmarking]] and [[social search]].
