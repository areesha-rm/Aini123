# Wikilinks Everywhere

- A [[project]]. [[open source]].
- The [[goal]] is to make [[wikilinks]] work everywhere on the internet.
  - A [[wikilink]] is any entity or phrase surrounded by two square brackets.
  - [[wikilinks]] can be [[lazily resolved]] in a user chosen [[context]].
    - Default context: an [[agora]] of the user's choice.
- It has a [[browser extension]] component.
  - The [[user]] can install an extension and see "dead" [[wikilinks]] "come to life" anywhere around the internet.
  - [[prototype]] [[agora ext]]
- It has a [[social network]] component.
  - People could start using [[wikilinks]] on any platform that supports user generated [[content]] online, social networks being likely the most popular interfaces.
  - For the purpose of connecting to such platforms we'd like to develop an [[agora bridge]].
