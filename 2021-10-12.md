- slept really badly but had a good day in the end.
- met [[pesho]] and [[ragnar]] in Tibits, had a great time
  - I talked a lot though, it happens in general and particular when I haven't slept well? hopefully I made sense at least some part of the time.
- [[alex leahu]] not only forked [[agora server]] (nice!) but fixed at least one bug and added [[docker]] support. cool!
- gave a presentation on [[stpa]]
