# Change the World

- A trite [[slogan]].
  - Also something that happens all the time. The world is what we've made of it, of a received material reality, after a series of steps to change it.
  - The world can only improve by changing it.
- Choose a [[way]]:
  - As [[society]] wills it, with the voice of the majority being given the most weight.
      - Through [[reform]] of our democratic systems.
    - As [[society]] wills it, with the voice of the most opressed being given the most weight.
      - Through [[revolution]].
    - As [[society]] wills it, with the voice of domain experts highly weighted.
      - Through [[heterarchical]] [[liquid democracy]].
