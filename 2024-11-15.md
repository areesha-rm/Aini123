- I [[worked]]; it was fine actually, I had a late review meeting (I don't usually have meetings on Fridays) but it was interesting/felt worth it.
- I met [[L]]! We spent some of the afternoon together. It was very nice to see her.
- I then worked on [[social.coop]], scaling up (with [[Dan]]). Then I read/wrote/coded a bit.
  - Maybe did yoga? But that was [[2024-11-16]] :)
