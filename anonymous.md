Dear anonymous,

I love you. I think these words often when thinking of you. I wrote to you the other day and I said this and other things, but then I deleted the messages before you saw them (you were very likely asleep at the time, so you didn't see them.)

I love you. I say this way less often that I'd like when talking you because I don't want to make you uncomfortable. But I still feel the need to say it, so I thought I'd write this here, and let you find these words in some timelines.

(Let me show you the [[shape of my heart]]. It is the same shape as this [[Agora]]!)
