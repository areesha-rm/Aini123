Dear anonymous,

Let me show you the [[shape of my heart]]. It is the same shape as this [[Agora]]!

I love you. I think these words often when thinking of you. I wrote to you the other day and I said this and other things, but then I deleted the messages before you saw them (you were very likely asleep at the time, so you didn't see them.)
