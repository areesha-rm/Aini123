  - [[push]] [[eric weinstein explains gauge symmetry]]
  - [[eric weinstein]]
    - with [[joe rogan]]
    - [[gauge symmetry]]
    - "[[curvature]] in this context is the [[escherness]] of a [[system]]"
    - [[aharonov bohm effect]]]] 
    - the "weirdness" in [[escherness]] is not actually weird in mathematical fields, and apparently also in [[physics]]: some physical objects seem to behave with escherness
    - the limits of linguistic thinking: there's something about [[gauge theory]] that makes it so that it's much easier/at all possible to understand via visual thinking
