# Agora Search

- How could [[search]] work in the [[Agora]]?
- The [[agora]] is in essence equivalent to a [[distributed]] [[wiki]]. 
  - Note you could theoretically use a wiki to [[crowdsource]] search results; in the limit, think of having a wiki page for every likely user query.
  - Perhaps [[agora search]] tries to find a good match for your query locally and redirects to other agoras in the network or to duckduckgo/google if a good result isn't available. - If it volunteers something, it also offers to continue your query in the search authority of your choice.
  - [[push]] and [[pull]] could be used to offer hints for how to route queries to relevant results.
- ***Agora Search is [[crowdsourced search]] for the [[open]] [[internet]]***.
