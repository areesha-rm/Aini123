    - Moloch is a high dimensional vector against interesting gradients in [[protopoi]], often taking the form of [[violence]] (the dark side of kings, states) and unsolved [[coordination problems]].

      - Currently includes social evils due to missed opportunities and the tendency of self-sustaining systems to stay put in idiosyncratic equilibriums, local optima.
      - Better optima become available with improvements in availability of resources, and improvements for communication and collaboration.
  - The Agora is my proposal for a tool for [[chasing moloch]].
