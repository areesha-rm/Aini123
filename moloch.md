- a [[being]].
  - an [[egregore]].
    - Apologies for calling it a [[thing]] at some point.
  - [[wp]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch
    - [[go]] [[wwp]]
  - [[pull]] [[meditations on moloch]]
  - An unnecessary vector against our desired gradient in [[protopoi]], often taking the form of [[coordination problems]].
  - Seems to imply social evils due to missed opportunities or idiosyncratic equilibriums / local optima.
