  - A Stoa is a subgroup of people in an [[Agora]] with compatible worldviews and conducive to cooperation. In particular, many Stoas are made of people closely aligned in goals and values.
  - Some possible Stoas:
    - The [[first stoa]] focuses on building and running an [[Agora]].
      - [[agora]]
    - The [[second stoa]] is focused on freeing and otherwise improving the [[internet. It likely interacts quite heavily with the first one.
      - [[flanbook]]
      - [[wikilinks everywhere]]
    - The [[third stoa]] is focused on world improvement: it seeks to build a dependency graph of important problems to work on and then tries to solve it given available resources.
