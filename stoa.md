- A [[place]].
	- to meet [[others]] with a good intent.
- In the [[historical agora]] of [[Athens]]:
	- A covered spot, usually a [[porch]], within the [[agora]].
		- So perhaps a [[semi public]] [[space]].
	- [[stoa of attalos]]
	- [[stoa poikile]]
		- [[stoicism]]
- In this [[agora]]:
	- Most succinctly, URL that allows [[iframes]] or announces other means of embedding or composing, ideally with a default intent of cooperation.
	- A [[stoa]] is a [[group]] with [[compatible]] [[worldviews]] willing to engage in [[cooperation]] towards [[goals]].
		- In particular, I believe well-working ("[[good]]") stoas are likely to be integrated by people with [[aligned]],[[supplementary]] or [[complementary]] (but in any case [[diverse]]), sets of [[goals]] and [[values]].
	- I would like to propose a number of Stoas. Each one depends in some way on the output of the formers.
		- The [[first stoa]] focuses on building and running an [[agora]].
			- See [[agora development]], [[agora plan]], [[agora feature requests]].
				- Also [[wikilinks everywhere]], [[browser extensions]], [[agora twitter integration]] if you're interested in specific projects.
			- See [[agora howto]] and [[agora client]] instead if you'd like to contribute to the [[agora]] as a [[user]].
			- This stoa should be instantiated by default with [[agora development]], the [[matrix]] channel.
		- The [[second stoa]] focuses on freeing, opening up and otherwise improving the [[internet]] using [[open source]] and [[open ethics]].
			- See [[fedstoa]] if you'd like to participate.
			- See also the next Stoa, some of whose members belong to the second Stoa :)
		- The [[third stoa]] moves (burns, in solarpunk terms) in the general direction of [[world improvement]]; I propose a default attitude of well-meaning [[protopianism]] and being out to do good.
			- This Stoa should be instantiated by default with [[flancia collective]] and [[agora discuss]], the [[matrix]] channels.
			- As of [[2022-01-30]] [[flancia collective]] tries to run a [[commons]] where [[interested people]] can [[work in public]] using public tools and procedures to model the world together, and so reason about possible improvements.
			- [[topics]]
				- [[world improvement]]: [[humanism]], [[solidarity]], [[m prime]], [[protopoi]],
				- [[agora]] (see also [[agora development]]).
					- The first goal of this Agora is to improve the world for others.
					- The second goal of this Agora is to build a better [[Agora]] :)
