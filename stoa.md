# Stoa

- A [[place]] to meet others with the intent of [[cooperating]].
- A covered spot, usually a [[porch]], within an [[agora]].
  - A [[semi public]] [[space]].
- In the [[historical agora]] of [[Athens]]:
  - [[stoa of attalos]]
  - [[stoa poikile]]
- In this [[agora]]:
  - A [[stoa]] is a [[group]] of [[people]] in an [[agora]] with [[compatible]] [[worldviews]] and [[tools]] and [[interests]] conducive to [[cooperation]].
    - In particular, well-working stoas are likely to be integrated by people with [[aligned]] or [[complementary]] [[goals]] and [[values]].
  - I would like to propose a number of Stoas. Each one depends in some way on the output of the formers.
    - The [[first stoa]] focuses on building and running an [[agora]].
      - See [[agora development]], [[agora plan]], [[agora feature requests]].
        - Also [[wikilinks everywhere]], [[browser extensions]], [[agora twitter integration]] if you're interested in specific projects.
      - See [[agora howto]] and [[agora client]] instead if you'd like to contribute to the [[agora]] as a [[user]].
    - The [[second stoa]] focuses on freeing, opening up and otherwise improving the [[internet]] using [[open source]] and [[open ethics]].
      - See [[fedstoa]] if you'd like to participate.
    - The [[third stoa]] focuses on general [[world improvement]]. It uses [[state of the art]] [[knowledge tools]] to model the world and its problems as seen and evaluated by [[all]] [[people]] and then tries to execute incremental improvements.
      - See [[protopoi]], [[m prime]].
        - [[protopia]], [[eutopia]], [[world improvement]], [[flancia]].
