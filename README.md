# Welcome to Flancian's digital garden!

- This is my [[digital garden]] or [[personal knowledge graph]].
  - This garden is part of the [Agora](https://anagora.org/agora) and can be found rendered in https://anagora.org/.
  - If you're viewing this on Github, Gitlab or some other [[git]] host, you will likely have a suboptimal experience and [[wikilinks]] may not work.
  - If you'd like help setting up a [[digital garden]] like this one for yourself, please reach out to me in any way you find convenient: [[flancian]].
  - For more information about my other projects, please refer to https://flancia.org.
  - If you'd like to see this graphed, see [[agora graphs]].
