# Flancian's digital garden

Welcome to my [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)!

This garden is part of the [Agora](https://flancia.org/go/agora) and can be found rendered in https://anagora.org/. If you're viewing this on Github, you will have a suboptimal experience (many links will be broken).

If you'd like help setting up a digital garden like this one for yourself, please reach out to me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/flancian.

For more information about my projects, please refer to https://flancia.org.
