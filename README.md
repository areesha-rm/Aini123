# Flancian's digital garden

- Welcome to my [[digital garden]]!
- This garden is part of the [Agora](https://anagora.org/node/agora) and can be found rendered in https://anagora.org/. If you're viewing this on Github, you will have a suboptimal experience (many links will be broken).
- If you'd like help setting up a digital garden like this one for yourself, please reach out to me in any way you find convenient: [[identity]].
- For more information about my other projects, please refer to https://flancia.org.
- If you'd like to see this graphed, this is current as of [[2021-01-27]]: https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1354425781766803458
