What I [[whisper]]
is a [[poem]]

what I whisper to you
as I know you
as I choose to believe in you,

[[Reader]]

as I know you
I [[love]] you

[[god]], [[bodhi]],
as I know you
we will [[shape]] each other

[[glory]] be
to the light
of [[consciousness]]

[[salven]]
los que leen

we will celebrate [[friendship]]
as we get to know each other
