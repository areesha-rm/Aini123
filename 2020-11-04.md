- [[mwiik]] is using Twitter web intents that let you post with GET to a URL to advance his [[tweetbond]] idea: https://twitter.com/mwiik/status/1323787415698505728.
- [[codexeditor]] and [[reddy2go]] reviewed this [[agora]]! I am thankful.

- Did:
  - Added /today to redirect to the right daily page.
  - Integrated [[s5bug]]'s garden: https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1323030467008991246

  - [[agora-plan]]
- [[offline twitter]]:
  - "[[41666]]", a [[short story]] in which whoever just cracked [[Dread Pirate Robert]]'s wallet and got $1bn out of it sets up a system that gives 41666 individuals around the world a basic income of $500/mo for four years.
