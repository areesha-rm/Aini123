- #push [[story]]

I was thinking about things yesterday and I thought: that's a third. A third most interesting thing, I mean: if I were to introduce a person to three concepts, and give then names, what would those be?

I've known some good first two for a while now. One example:

- [[Agora]]
- [[Moloch]]

Meaning two items that are interesting to describe, that describe things that you might want to have a name for, just because it helps with coordination.

But then you ask yourself: who's the third in that sequence? I say it's

- [[Avalokiteshvara]]

Then you ask: why? That is the topic of the above node, and perhaps also (if you have to choose one only), of the whole of the Agora of [[Flancia].

--

But if you take Avalokiteshvara, you might take them first -- then choose two other words to go with it.

Agora can be skipped this time, as the Agora can be seen to be linked to Avalokiteshvara.

In lieu of [[Moloch]] I would instead add then [[Maitreya]], who I believe will defeat them.

And then, to complete the healthy triplet, [[Tara]].
