# an open letter to the agora

- The [[book]] is my open letter, expanded, if you're interested in it.

I've been meaning to write this for a while, so I'll try to keep it short and simple.

We should try to use the Agora to form a humanistic, rational [[world government]] based on direct liquid democracy complementing [[nation states]].

Said another way, [[In Flancia world government was bootstrapped through a global social network implementing liquid democracy and rational heterarchies]].
