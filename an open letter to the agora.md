# an open letter to the agora

- #push [[open letter to the Agora]]
  - Flancia the [[book]] is my expanded open letter, if you're interested in it.

I've been meaning to write this for a while, so I'll try to keep it short and simple.

We should try to use the Agora to form a humanistic, rational [[world government]] based on direct liquid democracy complementing [[nation states]].

Said another way, [[In Flancia world government was bootstrapped through a global social network implementing liquid democracy and rational heterarchies]].
