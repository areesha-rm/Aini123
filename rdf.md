- I started a pomodoro of this but [[procrastination]] came up, interesting -- it's not like I'm not interested in this, but it just tends to happen I don't *get* to it because I'm busy with work and other things, so I ended up associating it with a frustrated feeling? Unsure. It could also be I have a fear of it being *precisely* the Agora, what that would mean. I should be elated if that happened, but on some level perhaps.
