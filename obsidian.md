# Obsidian

- a [[roam like]]
  - [[go]] https://obsidian.md
  - I liked it, tried it after [[roam]] -- but it's [[not]] [[open source]], so not sure if worth it over something like Foam.

  - [[foam]] seems more easily extensible to me.
  - This thread was what sealed the deal, didn't make it sound like open source was likely to happen anytime soon: https://forum.obsidian.md/t/open-sourcing-of-obsidian/1515
