# Obsidian

- an [[agora editor]]
  - [[roam like]]
  - [[go]] https://obsidian.md
  - as of [[2021-05-07]] the recommended [[agora editor]].
	  - previously I had tried it after [[roam]] -- but I left it behind for [[foam]] on due to it not being [[open source]].
	  - [[foam]] seemed more easily extensible to me.
  	  - This thread was what sealed the deal, didn't make it sound like open source was likely to happen anytime soon: https://forum.obsidian.md/t/open-sourcing-of-obsidian/1515 
	  - I wrote https://flancia.org/go/why-not-obsidian.
	  - as of [[2021-05-07]] I'm back to [[obsidian]] from [[foam]]. I no longer think it's a deal breaker as pro-social companies might need to ref
	    - See [[defoam]] for the process.
