# Obsidian

- a [[tool]]
	- for note taking/[[pkm]]; an [[agora editor]]
	- [[go]] https://obsidian.md
	- as of [[2021-05-07]] the recommended [[agora editor]].
	- previously I had tried it after [[roam]] -- but I left it behind for [[foam]] on due to it not being [[open source]].
	- [[foam]] seemed more easily extensible to me.
	- this thread was what sealed the deal, didn't make it sound like open source was likely to happen anytime soon: https://forum.obsidian.md/t/open-sourcing-of-obsidian/1515.  I then wrote https://flancia.org/go/why-not-obsidian.
	- as of [[2021-05-07]] I'm back to [[obsidian]] from [[foam]]. I no longer think it's a deal breaker as pro-social companies might need to refrain but being fully open at all times to remain competitive in the market, and Obsidian's business model (where they charge for optional features like sync and do not block community solutions in the same space) seems fair to me.
	- see [[defoam]] for a description of the migration process.
	- [[obsidian]] is [[faster]], [[polished]] and has a great [[community extensions]] market.
	- [[obsidian git]] is a great [[vault]] backup solution and open source. It replaces proprietary [[cloud sync]] -- which you need to pay for if you get it from [[obsidian]] directly.
