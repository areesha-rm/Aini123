# slaying moloch

- an [[intent]]
  - [[pull]] [[slay moloch]] [[some days I feel like slaying moloch]]
    - might trigger [[cringe]]
  - [[write]] [[essay]] 
    - I hope to write a draft of in [[summer 2021]]
    - despise the gruesome picture it may evoke, actually about [[building bridges]]
- [[push]] [[do]]
  - [[reread]] [[meditations on moloch]]
    - it left an impression on me, but I'm unsure how representative the impression I currently have of it, mutated by time and experience, matches what's there
    - I can't say I know it unless I reread it, and making Moloch a part of the [[flancia]] narrative would be irresponsible without revisiting this source.

  - [[read]] [[hyperion]]
    - I read some of it once upon a time, but I don't remember how much. I think I mix up [[dan simmons]] a bit with [[jack vance]].
