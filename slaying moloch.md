# slaying moloch

- [[pull]] [[slay moloch]] [[some days I feel like slaying moloch]]
- [[push]] [[liguria]]
  - a [[canto]] I hope to write a draft of in [[summer 2021]]
  - despise the gruesome picture it may evoke, actually about [[building bridges]]
- [[push]] [[do]]
  - [[reread]] [[meditations on moloch]]
  - [[read]] [[hyperion]]
    - I read some of it once upon a time, but I don't remember how much. I think I mix up [[dan simmons]] a bit with [[jack vance]].
