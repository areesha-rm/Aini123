# slaying moloch

- an [[intent]]
  - [[pull]] [[slay moloch]] 
  - despite the gruesome picture it may evoke, it is actually about [[building bridges]] -- a constructive path to slaying [[moloch]]
  - recently [[reread]] [[meditations on moloch]]
    - it left an impression on me, but I was unsure about how representative the impression I currently have of it, mutated by time and experience, matched what's there
    - I couldn't say comfortably I knew it unless I reread it, and making Moloch a part of the [[Flancia]] narrative would be irresponsible without revisiting this source. 
    - It holds up quite well, actually. See node.
  - [[some days I feel like slaying moloch]]
    - might trigger [[cringe]]
    - I mean to [[write]] a proper [[essay]] 
    - I hope to write a draft of it in [[2021]]
    - [[default instance]]
