- a [[thing]].
  - [[distributed knowledge graph]].
  - The brain of an [[Agora commons]].
  - See [[agora doc]].
- a [[project]].
  - I want to graph both the Agora as a whole and the context of a node in the agora, as per [[agora ui]].
  - local graphs: done (partial implementation).
  - global graph: running in dev but very resource intensive, may need to refactor/redo.
    - it could be cool to get a graph in [[agora doc]] though...
      - could be nice to do this through [[runnable subnodes]]:
        - [[javascript subnodes]]
        - [[python subnodes]]
    - did [[rdf]] first: exposed rdf for the agora and use something like [[rdf grapher]] to graph
