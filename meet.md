# Meet

- I built this [[agora]] in my pursuit to [[meet]] others to cooperate in concerns of [[public utility]].
  - I'd love to meet you. We can agree to meet on the below linked room to discuss anything you want.
    - [[go]] https://socialcoop.meet.coop/fla-hbe-i9q-e3p
	- I am interested particularly in: [[open source]], [[open ethics]], [[agora]], [[flancia]], [[personal knowledge management]], [[distributed knowledge graphs]], [[literature]], [[art]], [[machine learning]], [[ai]], [[protopoi]].
  - [[flancia]] is an [[open collective]].
  - I like [[google meet]] more than [[zoom]], but I can use any system that is convenient for you. [[jitsi meet]] or [[big blue button]] make me feel proud of [[open source]].
    - Feel free to book time on my calendar: [[go/flancian/calendly]]
    - [[doodle]] https://doodle.com/poll/tbk6222z3h7g3h27
	- calendly currently defaults to [[google meet]] but we can also meet in [[go/meet]], supported by [[meet coop]].
	- That's the [[go link]] <https://anagora.org/go/meet>.
