# Meet

- I built this [[agora]] in my pursuit to [[meet]] others to cooperate in concerns of [[public utility]].
    - [[go]] https://socialcoop.meet.coop/fla-hbe-i9q-e3p
  - [[flancia]] is an [[open collective]].
  - I like [[google meet]] more than [[zoom]], but I can use any system that is convenient for you. [[jitsi meet]] or [[big blue button]] make me feel proud of [[open source]].
    - Feel free to book time on my calendar: [[go/flancian/calendly]]
    - [[doodle]] https://doodle.com/poll/tbk6222z3h7g3h27
	- this currently defaults to [[goo]]
