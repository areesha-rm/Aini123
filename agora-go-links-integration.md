# Agora Go Links Integration

- I intend to implement this: when in an Agora subnode there is a block that begins with [[go]] and continues with a URL, the Agora will set up a [[go link]] with it and make it available at anagora.org/go/ + the node id. Example follows, pointing to precisely this node. Once this feature is implemented, if you visit anagora.org/go/agora-go-links-integration you'll be redirected to an article of mine on go links in flancia.org.
- [[go]] flancia.org/mine/go-links
- Note currently I run go links on https://flancia.org, my personal domain, and they're incomplete (they contain a subset of the go links in the Agora). I plan to enable Agora-dependent go links on [[2020-11-21]]. [[Agora plan]].
