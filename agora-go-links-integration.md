# Agora Go Links Integration

- I have implemented this: when in an Agora subnode there is a block that begins with [[go]] and continues with a URL, the Agora will set up a [[go link]] with it and make it available at anagora.org/go/ + the node id. Example follows.
  - [[go]] flancia.org/mine/go-links
  - Because of the above block, if you visit anagora.org/go/agora-go-links-integration you'll be redirected to an article of mine on go links in flancia.org.
- This was implemented on [[2020-11-21]] in [[Agora plan]].
- Note currently I also run go links on https://flancia.org, my personal domain, and they're incomplete (they contain a subset of the go links in the Agora). 
- Next up: handle the case in which several subnodes set up different go links.
    - Behaviour now: one is picked opaquely; the username with the username that comes first alphabetically "wins".
    - Expected behaviour: perhaps a list with all targets shows up, and then five seconds later the Agora redirects to the most highly ranked target (to begin with, the oldest?).
