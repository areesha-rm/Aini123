  - [[category theory]]
    - [[steffen]] did some during earlier studies -- perhaps it was too early. Later in studies it came very handy.
    - also used it in [[haskell]]
    - it's useful because you can map betwen categories
      - had algebraic data types
      - wanted to do probability theory
      - you can map between the two

      - a bit [[disappointed]]
        - missing the programmability aspect
          - had a bucket of things: things in software that [[should not be this way]]

              - [[do]] link
          - wanted to write a twitter thread about these things, but rearranging/editing some things.

        - [[push]] [[agora feature requests]]
          - can you query a [[link path]] between two nodes
            - perhaps traversing n people's graph
        - [[flancian]] they endorsed [[palantir]] publicly, that is worrying to me
          - but mostly it's just the issue they're [[for profit]] and [[closed source]]
    - [[q]] which tool are you using right now?
      - [[a]] tried [[roam]] first as per the above
      - still using [[evernote]]
        - they rewrote it with good intentions and (surprise) it didn't work
