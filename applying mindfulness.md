# applying mindfulness

- [[joseph goldstein]] says, after the [[buddha]], that the application of mindfulness must vary according to the nature of the thoughts being observed.
  - thoughts can be skillful or unskillfull.
    - unskillfull thoughts must be analyzed with full attention; recognized; one can remind oneself that "this kind of thought leads to affliction". [[cowherd parable]].
