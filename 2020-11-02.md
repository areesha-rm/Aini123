- Spoke to [[ding-levery]], [[abstractfairy]] about how the Agora could work.
  - Ding is interested in [[agora-protocol]], [[twitter]] integration.
  - [[abstractfairy]] is interested in [[ranking]], [[tags]], [[graphing]].
- Wrote [[agora-help]], [[foo]], [[wikilink]] as they're featured as examples in the Agora.
- Fixed [[daily]], whose format was not working in the Agora.
- Today:
  - Implemented backlinks.
  - Added logo.
- Next:
  - Implement search (full text).
  - Move uwsgi/prod serving off my user into 'agora'.
  - Add monitoring/alerting.
  - Make the index be just another note [[ding-levery]].
  - Help [[s5bug]] and [[jonathan-the-utopian]] integrate.
  - Define special pages. Are there any?
    - README is already one, it seems.
    - CONTRACT seems important.
    - No more likely for now; we want to reserve all caps for things that are really special.
    - Nodal pages could become special over time. No need for caps really.
