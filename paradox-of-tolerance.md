# Paradox of Tolerance

- [[go]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance
  - The paradox of tolerance states that if a [[society]] is [[tolerant]] without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant. [[Karl Popper]] described it as the seemingly paradoxical idea that in order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant of intolerance.

- Interesting that https://medium.com/@giggsboson/stop-misusing-poppers-paradox-of-tolerence-in-free-speech-debates-6f6ab4b8f0d3 says that [[Karl Popper]] argued for something a bit different: Popper cared most about people giving rational debate a chance.
