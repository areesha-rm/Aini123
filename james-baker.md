## 2020-11-27

- [[software developer]] in his first career.
  - Hello from the future!
  - Financial independence.
- [[awakening]] came through [[career]] in a while. Joined a startup ([[tableau]]).
  - 5-6y of hard coding.
  - Some management.
  - Company kept growing: from 50 people to several thousands.
  - The most fascinating topic in time became scaling itself. Organizational complexities. 
    - Organizations as systems.
    - How do systems grow, scale or break?
    - This pulled him out of conventional thinking and into more abstract/outside perspectives.
    - Complex systems.
  - Ended up doing [[branch management]], [[release cycle]]s.
  - With time took on more problems having to do with human scaling more than software systems.
    - [[psychological safety]]
    - [[leadership]]
    - [[cultural shift]] towards quality
      - a break from startup culture
  - [[interference]] with executives and company 
    - ran into trouble with the cultural shift
    - ran into the limit of personal skills too
- pushed through [[existential crisis]]
  - [[secular buddhism]]
  - [[post-conventional self-identity]], [[kegan stage]]s, [[deconstruction]]
  - tried [[employee]] [[activism]], intending to have it be self-organizing, not leading it.
    - extended his time at the company
    - cared for the people
    - inspired by [[google walkout]]
    - main objective: raising [[awareness]], helps others become aware
  - movement wounded by [[pandemic]] 

## Q&A
- What's your opinion w.r.t. [[union]]s?
  - Complicated. Logical counterbalancing force: collective power vs corporate power. But it seems, as far as structures go, to be trapped in a local minimum.
  - Global optimum lies elsewhere; rather than counterbalancing, how could we dissolve the need for poles?
    - Perhaps we should have user, data unions. More cooperatives.
