# Paladin

- [[push]] [[rpg]]
  - I sometimes think of playing a [[paladin]] but I don't follow through with it.
  - It seems to me being a [[paladin]] is sometimes easier; you don't get to use your head that much, at least. Many more decisions are just taken for you by the culturally transmitted conventional sense of order and good.
