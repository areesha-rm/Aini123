# Transclusion

- A method for [[embedding]].
- It is akin to a pointer to a frame. More efficient than [[copying]].
- Because pointers define a graph, if the pointers are annotated this reduces to a [[hypergraph]]. I belive a hypergraph is can be used to sufficiently and efficiently encode all human thought.

  - Am I crazy or would [[iframes]] do an acceptable job? Instead of querying data sources via an API, presumably I could just embed other web properties.
