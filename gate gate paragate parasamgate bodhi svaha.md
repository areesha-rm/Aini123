# gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha

- A [[mantra]].
  - I think this often.
  - I identify it with [[Maitreya]], although it is most closely linked in scriptures ([[Heart Sutra]]) to [[Avalokiteshvara]].
    - [[17]] syllables.
  - Sometimes I say it while lighting a candle. I think it makes sense, although I try to remember it is best not to become attached to [[ritual]].
    - gone ~ [[gate]]
    - gone beyond to the other shore ~ [[paragate]]
    - completely gone to the further shore ~ [[parasamgate]]
    - awakening ~ [[bodhi]]
    - svaha ~ (interjection)
