# Arcades
- A self-contained semi-open space.
	- In the case of the [[Arcades Project]] and traditional arcades, these spaces were mostly oriented towards consumerism -- and [[flaneurism]]. 
		- But probably not in [[Flancia]], where often they work as [[stoas]].
- a [[pattern]]
	- in [[a pattern language]]

	- "this is one of the most beautiful patterns in the language" 
	- "covered walkways at the edge of buildings, which are partly inside, partly outside"
	- buildings are more unfriendly that they need to be; they could be more inviting. the arcade is a solution to this: a semi-public space at the edge of the building.

	- a [[liminal space]]
