# Arcades
- a self-contained semi-open space.
	- In the case of the [[arcades project]], these spaces were mostly oriented towards consumerism -- and [[flaneurism]]. 
	- they were mostly [[shopping arcades]]. but probably not in [[Flancia]], where often they work as [[stoas]].
- a [[pattern]]
	- in [[a pattern language]]

	- "this is one of the most beautiful patterns in the language" 
	- "covered walkways at the edge of buildings, which are partly inside, partly outside"
	- buildings are more unfriendly that they need to be; they could be more inviting. the arcade is a solution to this: a semi-public space at the edge of the building.
	- a [[liminal space]]
		- [[stoa]]
	- [[properties for arcades]]
		- they must contain the [[character]] of the inside
		- they must work as an extension of the inside and therefore be [[covered]]
		- the edges of the ceiling must not be too high
		- if possible, the path should pass through buildings (in particular if they are narrow) or connect buildings to each other
	- [[rudofsky]] in [[streets for people]] says they "take the place of the ancient forum" -- the [[agora]] :)
		- he calls them "the most refined street coverings, a tangible expression of civic solidarity -- or, should one say, of philanthropy"
