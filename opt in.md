# opt in
- The [[agora]] tries to be [[opt in]] for the good of the [[users]], be them [[anonymous]] or [[logged in]].
	- An [[agora]] might choose to default logged in users to [[opt out]] behaviour; [[an agora]]'s users can vote to change defaults.
	- As of [[2022-05-21]] this is the state of opt in for [[agora bot]]:
		- [[hashtags]]
			- are [[opt out]] in [[mastodon]] and [[matrix]]
			- are [[opt in]] in [[twitter]]
				- meaning they are disabled by request of a user, and I'll now try to do work on making them available via an opt in mechanism.
				- DONE improve this and reenable

					- I think it works :)
					- now the question is: should this be [[opt out]] to begin with now we have an opt-in/out mechanism?
					- this might make sense as you need to opt in in the first place by *following [[agora bot]]*, so then opting out whenever the bot does something you don't like (if we make it easy/quick) could be maximally ergonomic.
