# opt in
- The [[agora]] tries to be [[opt in]] for the good of the [[users]], be them [[anonymous]] or [[logged in]].
	- An [[agora]] might choose to default logged in users to [[opt out]] behaviour; this means that an [[an agora]]'s users vote to make this change.
	- As of [[2022-05-21]] this is the state of opt in for [[agora bot]]:
		- [[hashtags]]
			- are [[opt out]] in [[mastodon]] and [[matrix]]
			- are [[opt in]] in [[twitter]]
				- meaning they are disabled by request of a user, and I'll now try to do work on making them available via an opt in mechanism.
