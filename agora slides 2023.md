As of [[2023-09-10]], I am working on updating this with the [[Fellowship of the Link]] as its intended audience.

What needs updating? Before diving into it, I would guess:

1. Mention the diversity and interest that its community brings into the Commons. ~60/150 direct contributors as of the time of writing depending on how you count.
2. Mention social media integration (Mastodon bot) and other venues for integration with the [[Fediverse]].
3. Update screenshots (this will be a good opportunity to reconsider some of the changes introduced since 2021, likely).

What else would need to be added?

1. Maybe a mention of the Agora chapter in the [[personal knowledge graphs]] book.
2. A mention of upcoming work:
  - ActivityPub integration.
  - SQLite/more stateful Agora.
  - Oauth/other repository providers incoming.

Wikilinks stand for the *intention to socially link*.

- Counter-argument 1: two square brackets is a lot of brackets.
  - Counter-counter-argument 1.1: 

Counter argument in general: on the value of [[building bridges]] and doing meaningful work in the [[Commons]].

#Flancia is an entity of category [[protopoi]].

The #Agora is an entity of category [[Commons]].

(Here I took a detour to clean the kitchen and think of [[magnetic 3d printing]])

You can currently join an Agora in two ways:

- Keep a [[digital garden]] and contribute it to the Agora in question, as defined by you and your friends with loving-kindness :)
- Follow @agora@botsin.space in the Fediverse and start using [[agora protocol]] in public, or within earshot of the bot.

First services in the Commons: 

- Sharing. 
- Embedding.
- Printing. 
- Format conversion.
- Bridging,
  - meaning porting across all useful and pro-social combinations of formats/mediums/networks.

---

In the Agora your friends are the integration of your friendships over all participating social networks.

I searched for [[markdown to google slides]] and I found https://github.com/googleworkspace/md2googleslides thanks precisely to the Agora.

Love how the Agora is self-documenting ;)
