As of [[2023-09-10]], I am working on updating this with the [[Fellowship of the Link]] as its intended audience.

What needs updating? Before diving into it, I would guess:

1. More users.
2. Mention social media integration (mastodon bot).
3. Screenshots (this will be a good opportunity to reconsider some of the changes introduced since 2021, likely).

What else would need to be added?

1. Maybe a mention of the Agora chapter in the [[personal knowledge graphs]] book.
2. A mention of upcoming work:
  - ActivityPub integration.
  - SQLite/more stateful Agora.
  - Oauth/other repository providers incoming.

Wikilinks stand for the *intention to socially link*.

- Counter-argument 1: two square brackets is a lot of brackets.
  - Counter-counter-argument 1.1: 

[[Building bridges]].

#Flancia is an entity of category [[protopoi]].

The #Agora is an entity of category [[Commons]].

(Here I took a detour to clean the kitchen and think of [[magnetic 4d printing]])
