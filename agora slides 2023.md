As of [[2023-09-10]], I am working on updating this with the [[Fellowship of the Link]] as its intended audience.

What needs updating? Before diving into it, I would guess:

1. More users.
2. Mention social media integration (mastodon bot).
3. Screenshots (this will be a good opportunity to reconsider some of the changes introduced since 2021, likely).

What else would need to be added?

1. Maybe a mention of the Agora chapter in the [[personal knowledge graphs]] book.
2. A mention of upcoming work:
  - ActivityPub integration.
  - SQLite/more stateful Agora.
  - Oauth/other repository providers incoming.

Wikilinks stand for the *intention to socially link*.
