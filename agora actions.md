# Agora Actions

- an [[agora feature]]
  - The Agora can trigger actions in the context of a node when said node includes a block with a [[wikilink]] or [[hashtag]] representing an [[intent]]. Those intents include [[actions]]. 
  - If you tell an [[agora]] about your intents in your notes, it will actuate them for you if it ll will do it for you if it can. If it can't, it'll keep a record of the request and fulfill it once it's tractable.
- a [[list]].
	- of actions supported by <https://anagora.org>.
	- [[go]], which redirects to a canonical link
		- [[composite go links]]
    - [[pull]], which transcludes a target node or subnode into the current context.
	- [[push]], which transcludes subordinate blogs to the target.
	- [[annotate]] (alpha), which redirects to the via.hypothes.is link for a given resource.
	- [[turtle]] (alpha), which returns RDF for a node.
	- [[receive]] (planned), which hints points of transclusion for [[push]].
		  - If you pull a node by mentioning this action in its vicinity, it gets 'upranked' in the context of the current node. In <https://anagora.org>, that means included. Example follows.
	- [[pull]] [[push and pull]] [[planned actions]]
