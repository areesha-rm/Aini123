# Agora Actions

- an [[agora feature]]
  - The Agora can trigger actions in the context of a node when said node includes a block with a [[wikilink]] representing an [[intention]] to execute an [[intent]]. Those intents include [[actions]]. 
  - If you tell an [[agora]] where your data is, and what you want to do with it, it'll will do it for you if it can. If it can't, it'll keep a record of the request and fulfill it once it's tractabl
- a [[list]].
	- of actions supported by <https://anagora.org>.
	- [[go]], which redirects to a canonical link
		- [[composite go links]]
    - [[pull]], which transcludes a target node or subnode into the current context.
	- [[push]], which transcludes children 
	- [[annotate]] (alpha)
	- [[turtle]] (alpha)
	- [[receive]] (planned)
	
		  - Pull can be seen as a [[force]].
		  - If you pull a node by mentioning this action in its vicinity, it gets 'upranked' in the context of the current node. In <https://anagora.org>, that means included. Example follows.
		  
- [[pull]] [[agora action]]
        - (see below for effect)
    - *push*, which transcludes the current *block* and any children to the target node. 
      - [[push]] [[2021-01-25]] 
        - I first documented *push* on that day.
        - (visit [[2021-01-25]] to see the effect)
  - See also:
    - [[push and pull]] for interactions between those two actions.
    - [[planned actions]].
