# Agora Actions

- a [[project]]
  - The Agora can trigger actions in the context of a node when said node includes a block with a [[wikilink]] representing an [[intention]] to execute an [[intent]]. Those intents include [[actions]]. 
  - If you tell an [[agora]] where your data is, and what you want to do with it, it'll will do it for you if it can. If it can't, it'll keep a record of the request and fulfill it once it's tractabl
- a [[list]].
	- Actions supported by <https://anagora.org>.
	- [[go]]
	   - which makes the command 'go' (https://anagora.org/go/<node>) redirect to the mentioned url when the parameter passed is a node name -- that is, a [[wikilink]].
		- [[composite go links]]
	- [[push]]
	- [[pull]]
	- [[annotate]] (alpha)
	- [[turtle]] (alpha)
	- [[receive]] (planned)
		- [[go]] https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1329890862499770368
		- <https://anagora.org/go/agora-actions> now redirects to the tweet above.
	- If you trigger it by writing on social media or another remote control surface, the [[agora]] will link the resulting resource.
		- This is inspired by [[go links]] as currently in use in several tech companies.
		- See also [[composite-go-links]].
    - *pull*, which transcludes a target node or subnode into the current context.
      - Pull can be seen as a [[force]].
      - If you pull a node by mentioning this action in its vicinity, it gets 'upranked' in the context of the current node. In <https://anagora.org>, that means included. Example follows.
        - [[pull]] [[agora action]]
        - (see below for effect)
    - *push*, which transcludes the current *block* and any children to the target node. 
      - [[push]] [[2021-01-25]] 
        - I first documented *push* on that day.
        - (visit [[2021-01-25]] to see the effect)
  - See also:
    - [[push and pull]] for interactions between those two actions.
    - [[planned actions]].
