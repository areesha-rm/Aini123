- Trying [[Obsidian]] after a looong time -- after remembering, and then trying on a lark, [[Roam Research]] again :)
	- I also tried [[logseq]] but it did a mega-commit automatically on my garden which almost broke it, not super happy about that (it tried to commit and push a 101MB file that is a database for [[silverbullet]] and probably, granted, should have been in .gitignore).
