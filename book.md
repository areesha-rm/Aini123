# Book

- A [[thing]].
  - A [[bag of holding]].
  - [[convergent]] with or perhaps [[equivalent]] to the stuff and knowledge in it carried or transitively derived.

I'm trying to write a book. I call it [[Flancia]]. I have lofty aspirations, as per usual, but it is really only a rough [[draft]].

In lieu of the book, you'll have to accept this: this note you're reading, and the links you may choose to follow as you find them embedded in this sometimes awkward medium, which I'm putting together as a gift for [[you]].

These are the chapters of [[Flancia]]:

- [[meta]]
- [[manifesto]]

- [[On building bridges]].
- [[In Flancia there is an Agora]].
- [[In Flancia there is no violence]].
- [[In Flancia there are no rulers]].
- [[In an Agora there are many Stoas]].
- [[Towards Caramel City]].
- [[Against gag orders]].
- [[Open Ethics]].
- [[Protopoi Space]].
- [[On the pedagogy of the revolution]].

Please consider this an offering to the [[people]].

Have a nice day! I hope you [[thrive]].
