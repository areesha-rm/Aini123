# Book

- A [[thing]].
  - A [[bag of holding]].
  - [[equivalent]] to all the knowledge and beauty potentially contained transitively therein.

I'm writing a book. I call it [[Flancia]]. I have lofty aspirations but it is only a [[draft]].

It is currently just this: this note you're reading, and the links you may choose to follow in this awkward medium, which I've put together as a gift for [[you]]. An offering for the [[people]].

These are the chapters of Flancia:

- [[Manifesto]].
- [[On building bridges]].
- [[In Flancia there is an Agora]].
- [[In Flancia there is no violence]].
- [[In Flancia there are no rulers]].
- [[Towards Caramel City]].
- [[Against gag orders]].
- [[Open Ethics]].
- [[In Protopoi Space]].
- [[On the pedagogy of the revolution]].
