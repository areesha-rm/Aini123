# Book

- A [[thing]].
	- [[pull]] [[books]].
- A [[bag of holding]].
	- [[conducive]] or [[convergent]] with the material reality and knowledge that in it you can carry or you can transitively derive.
	- In this bag you have: [[our mathematical universe]].

I'm trying to write this book. I call it [[Flancia]]. It is currently only a rough [[draft]].

Because I'm slow and I'm dumb, in place of the book, you'll have to accept this: this note you're reading, and the links you may choose to follow. 

Welcome to [[Flancia]], or [[building bridges]]:

- [[Meta]].
- [[Manifesto]].
- [[In Flancia we share clear goals]].
- [[In Flancia there is an Agora]].
- [[In Flancia there is no poverty]].
- [[In Flancia there is no privilege]].
- [[In Flancia there is no violence]].
- [[In Flancia everybody thrives]].
- [[In Flancia we will one day meet]].
- [[In Flancia there are few walled gardens]].
- [[In Flancia there are many cooperatives]].
- [[In Flancia government is a digital heterarchy]].
- [[Caramel City]].
- [[Against gag orders]].
- [[Against copyright]].
- [[Protopoi]].
- [[Open ethics]].
- [[On the pedagogy of the revolution]].

Please consider this an offering to all [[good people]].

Have a nice day! I hope you [[thrive]].
