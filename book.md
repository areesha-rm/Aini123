# Book

- A [[thing]].
	- [[pull]] [[books]].
- A [[bag of holding]].
	- [[conducive]] or [[convergent]] to the stuff and knowledge that in it you can carry or you can transitively derive.

I'm trying to write a book. I call it [[Flancia]]. I have lofty aspirations, as usual, but it is really only a rough [[draft]].

In lieu of the book, you'll have to accept this: this note you're reading, and the links you may choose to follow as you find them embedded in this sometimes awkward medium, which I'm trying to put together as a gift.

[[Flancia]], or [[building bridges]]:

- [[Meta]].
- [[Manifesto]].
- [[In Flancia we share clear goals]].
- [[In Flancia there is an Agora]].
- [[In Flancia there is no poverty]].
- [[In Flancia there is no privilege]].
- [[In Flancia there is no violence]].
- [[In Flancia there are no walled gardens]].
- [[In Flancia there]].
- [[In Flancia there is liquid democracy]].
- [[In Flancia we will one day meet]].
- [[Caramel City]].
- [[Against gag orders]].
- [[Stoas]].
- [[Protopoi]].
- [[Open Ethics]].
- [[On the Pedagogy of the Revolution]].

Please consider this an offering to the [[people]].

Have a nice day! I hope you [[thrive]].
