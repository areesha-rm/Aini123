# Book

- A [[thing]].
  - A [[bag of holding]].
  - [[equivalent]] to all the knowledge, art and beauty potentially contained or derived transitively therein.

I'm writing a book. I call it [[Flancia]]. I have lofty aspirations, as per usual, but it is really only a rough [[draft]].

In lieu of a book, perhaps accept this: this note you're reading, and the links you may choose to follow as embedded in this sometimes awkward medium, which I've put together as a gift for [[you]]. 

These are the chapters:

- [[Manifesto]].
- [[On building bridges]].
- [[In Flancia there is an Agora]].
- [[In Flancia there is no violence]].
- [[In Flancia there are no rulers]].
- [[Towards Caramel City]].
- [[Against gag orders]].
- [[Open Ethics]].
- [[Protopoi Space]].
- [[On the pedagogy of the revolution]].

Consider this an offering to the [[people]]. 

Have a nice day, and may you ever [[thrive]]!
