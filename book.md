# Book

- A [[thing]].
  - A [[bag of holding]].
  - [[equivalent]] to the knowledge and beauty contained therein.

I'm writing a book. I call it [[Flancia]]. I try to have lofty ideals but it is only a [[draft]].

It is currently just this: this note you're reading, and the links you follow in this platform, which I've partly put together as a gift for [[you]].

- [[In Flancia there is an Agora]].
- [[In Flancia there is no violence]].
- [[Caramel city]].
- [[Against gag orders]].
- [[On the pedagogy of revolution]].
