# Entity

- A [[thing]] or a [[being]] with distinct and independent [[existence]].
- In the [[agora]], entities map to [[all possible wikilinks]].
  - In the [[agora]], there are no 404s.
  - All [[agora url space]] is owned by its users. Entities are top level items, like so: <anagora.org/entity>. And because subnodes in the agora are [[crowdsourced]] and are served by the [[agora]] at reasonable (related) URLs, users control this space.
  - You can think of the [[agora]] as a [[crowdsourced]] [[search engine]].
