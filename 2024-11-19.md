- questions for single stack talk
  - 1. with vvssrcs, do we end up open to a new class of bug? could we end up e.g. mis-attributing video or audio?
  - 2. how do we plan to handle the migration to reliable presence and in particular reliable pushes? do we see MAS calling out to MR during the migration phase, or will we continue to rely on spanner state for old clients?
  - 3. not fully sold on SSSS. it seems this would unlock 'everybody sees participants in the same order', which can occasionally come in handy for in-meeting coordination (a nice to have)
