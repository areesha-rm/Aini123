- [[work]]
  - I woke up sick but I worked from home anyway.
  - [[Meet University]] was good!
- then I rested after work, ate something, spent time with [[Burup]] and caught up with friends
- then I thought about:
  - [[Ekumen]]:
    - Spoke to [[Eduardo Mercovich]] about next steps, caught up with email :)
    - [ ] Set up coordination device for first meeting
      - What's the name of that nice modern [[doodle alternative]] again...?
      - We used it in the [[twg]]]...
      - [[crab fit]]!
    - Update git repo in some interesting way?
    - What about [[ekumen.agor.ai]]? :) 
- [[cwebber]] joined [[social.coop]] earlier this week!
