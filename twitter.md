# Twitter
- [[Twitter]] could be part of the [[Agora]].
  - The [[Agora]] can exist anywhere in the internet where users can generate content.
  - I have started using [[wikilinks everywhere]]; even if they won't work right now, we'll make them work later :)
    - For example with one of our planned [[browser extensions]].
    - Or just by setting up processes that "pull" all tweets with explicit wikilinks as backlinks to matching nodes.
    - See [[agora-twitter-integration]].
- Aside: I hope [[Mastodon]] can replace Twitter some day, as it's open and user controlled.
- See also: 
  - [[tweet]] for, well, direct links to tweets.
  - Backlinks here for every person with a known Twitter account.
