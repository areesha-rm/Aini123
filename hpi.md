  - [[quote]] TLDR: I’m using HPI (Human Programming Interface) package as a means of unifying, accessing and interacting with all of my personal data. The package hides the gory details of locating data, parsing, error handling and caching. You simply ‘import’ your data and get to work with familiar Python types and data structures.
