I have a fever and that got me thinking.

About the immune system, and how the body (our genome and gut flora and other symbionts) regulates our temperature to react to infections and other invasive entities; or while reacting to those.

About how our bodies tend to raise their temperature considerably above their environment (what's the yearly average? probably 20 degrees or so in temperate latitudes?)
