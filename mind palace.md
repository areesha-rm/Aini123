# Mind Palace

- #pull [[method of loci]]
  - I have a mind palace, I guess. It happened organically; it grew from my [[meditation practice]], which at times involves counting and factoring [[numbers]].
  - I think I should have a canonical node for all the number-concept (or person, or thing) associations, but I'm not sure what it is currently and I'm writing this in a plane.
  - #pull [[braids]] might not be a bad place to start.
  - I have concepts associated up to number 119 as of the time of writing, sparsely -- most are in the first 31, which I also associate with the calendar day and use for planning.
