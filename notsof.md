- The ultimate [[object of design]] is [[form]].
- [[form]] + [[context]] == [[ensemble]]
- It is peculiar how much of the comments on [[ensembles]] apply to [[systems]] in general. This book so far often reads like [[christopher alexander]] has independently discovered principles in use in [[computer science]]; or, of course, perhaps [[computer science]] is just one possible take on the nature of [[complex systems]].
  - I am curious to know if people in the reading group with different backgrounds to mine, but whose primary activity is also not [[architecture]], get similar impressions w.r.t. their disciplines.
- The [[rightness of form]] depends on the degree to which a form fits an [[ensemble]] .
- Ensembles can be decomposed into many [[form-context boundaries]].
