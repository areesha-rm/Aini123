# default mode

- my [[default mode]]:
  - [[pull]] [[flancia soundscape]] [[agora]]
  - I'm trying to make my default mode be [[flancia]]. That means: a state of consciousness I can experiment to some extent, whenever I can recall it or shape the world into its topology.
  - For that purpose I'm writing a [[book]].
  - [[project snapshot]] is a tech oriented manifestation of my intent to automate myself into entering or remaining in this state.
