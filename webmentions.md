- [[pull]] [[webmention]]
- [[go]] https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/
  - "Webmention is a simple way to notify any URL when you mention it on your site. From the receiver's perspective, it's a way to request notifications when other sites mention it."

- I think [[agora protocol]] is a bit like [[webmentions]] for [[wikilinks]]?
