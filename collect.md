# collect

- [[pull]] [[garbage collect]]
- a [[function]]
  - takes items and adds them to a collection/container
  - this applies to a procedure I sometimes run on my todo items: take items in a given container (say, post-its on my desk), filter them (discard those that are no longer relevant/up to date) and then collect (move over to a better longer term container, like a list in the [[agora]])
