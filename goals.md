# Goals

- These are my [[goals]]. What are yours?
  - To establish a collective: [[flancia collective]].
  - To build [[an agora]]: this [[agora]], which is hopefully only one of many.
      - This particular Agora is an [[experimental]] [[social network]] assembled around a [[distributed knowledge graph]].
      - It is my [[intent]] for this Agora to be a commons where people can meet and cooperate on common goals in the space of [[world improvement]].
      - I, its [[maintainer]], intend to evolve the Agora in directions that [[maximize constructive dialogue]] and [[unlock potential for collaboration]].
  - To do what I can to help conscious beings thrive and reach their ideal target mental states: [[ataraxia]], [[eudaimonia]], [[happiness]], [[enlightenment]].
    - To practice [[effective altruism]].
  - To drive and support projects of [[public utility]].
