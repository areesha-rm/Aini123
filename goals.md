# Goals

- These are my [[goals]]. What are yours?
- To build an [[Agora]].
    - The Agora is an [[experimental]] [[social network]].
    - If you want to learn more about the [[experimental]] nature of this Agora, please refer to [this Hacker News comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25577016).
    - It is my [[intent]] for this Agora to be a space where people can try to be open with their goals -- and thus more likely to find cooperators.
    - I, the [[maintainer]], intend to evolve the Agora in directions that [[maximizes constructive dialogue]] and [[unlocks potential for collaboration]].
- To do what I can to help conscious beings thrive and reach their ideal target mental states: [[ataraxia]], [[eudaimonia]], [[happiness]], [[enlightenment]].
  - To practice [[effective altruism]].
- To drive and support projects of [[public utility]].
