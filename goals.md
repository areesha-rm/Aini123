# Goals

- To build an [[Agora]].
  - The Agora is an [[experimental]] [[social network]].
  - If you want to learn more about the [[experimental]] nature of this Agora, please refer to [this Hacker News comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25577016).
  - In this Agora people try to be open with their goals and collaborate on those whenever possible. 
  - I, the [[maintainer]], intend to evolve the Agora in a direction that [[maximizes constructive dialogue]] and [[unlocks potential for collaboration]].
- To do what I can to help all conscious beings thrive and reach their ideal target mental states: [[ataraxia]], [[eudaimonia]], [[happiness]], [[enlightenment]].
- These are my goals. What are yours?
