# Goals

- To build an [[Agora]].
  - The Agora is an [[experimental]] [[social network]].
  - If you want to learn more about the [[experimental]] nature of this Agora, please refer to [this Hacker News comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25577016).
- To do what I can to help all conscious beings thrive and reach their ideal target mental states, for example: [[ataraxia]], [[eudaimonia]], [[happiness]].
- In the Agora people try to be open with their goals. These are mine. What are yours?
