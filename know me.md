# know me

- [[pull]] [[flancian]]

It was in my childhood that I first saw the Agora, but I didn't know it as such back then.

I stayed up reading books when I was a child; as I grew up I stayed up also [[online]], as the late nineties hit and I could finally access the [[internet]]. 

[[Sandokan]] fought the authority and had adventures. [[Guybrush Threepwood]] inspired me. [[Borges]] built libraries and labyrinths in my mind. An then the internet set it free. That's me in a nutshell.

Some people call me an [[optimist]]. It is up to the optimists to build an [[Agora]].
