# Agora Hub

- The Agora is a bit about integrating the best out there, in a sense; that's what I believe could be a competitive advantage of open source.
- Companies are usually motivated not to cooperate with others, because they want an edge in the market. This forces them to close down, and it means every company needs to implement a lot of the same stuff independently. It's so inefficient.
- Open source can be fully open because it has open intentions. Every platform is open by default to collaboration, because openness is symmetric, and integrating with a product usually means you get after integrating you get something for no recurring costs.
- This makes it so that n products or open platforms will tend to integrate, presumably, if they see value in it. The issue is that integrations themselves are costly, because they are a full graph, which has n! directed edges.
- The Agora is an attempt to work around this by clearly defining a neutral ground, which can then be used to build a hub. A hub is a highly connected node. In the previous graph of n, if all nodes trust hub h, complexity of integration drops to n.
