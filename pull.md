# Pull

- An [[action]].
- The inverse of [[push]].
- Pull and push might be used to implement broadcast and [[transclusion]], plus perhaps interest signaling.
- Note that in the context of a social network like the [[Agora]] "pull requests" to a node might be related to [[ranking]].
- See also: [[aka]].
