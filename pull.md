# Pull

- An [[action]].
- The inverse of [[go]].
  - '[[pull]] [[agora action]]' makes sense both in [[action]] and here in pull. It means that agora action should perhaps redirect to one of us.
  - It 'pulls attention' from the node referenced to the current node.
- Note 'go', 'pull' can be thought of as "active" forward links and backlinks.
- Can be used to implement broadcast, synonims, canonical terms, interest signaling.
  - Node [[united states]] may [[pull]] USA.
- Can provide benefits on both sides; those of the node pulling and those of the node being pulled.
  - In the context of a [[digital garden]], pull links function as a sort of inverse of the [[go]] link. They are equivalent to visiting the parameter node ("USA") and adding a go link to it pointing to the current one ("United States").
  - Note that in the context of a social network like the [[Agora]] those benefits can get to have a real life effect on people and their work; "pulling attention" is related to [[ranking]].
