# Pull

- An [[action]].
- If you use this action, it will pull the target nodes to the current context. Like so:
  - [[pull]] [[pulled nodes]]
- Pulling means that the target nodes show up after the node you are visiting; and said nodes show in the [[pulled]] [[links]] section.
- [[push]] doesn't exist yet, but might soon. It'll be close to its inverse.
  - Pull and push might be seen as simple versions of [[transclusion]] and [[broadcast]] respectively.
- Note that in the context of a social network like the [[Agora]] "pull requests" to a node can be made to influence [[ranking]] and might help when trying to determine [[canonical forms]].
