# Pull

- An [[action]].
- If you use this action, it will pull the target nodes to the current context. Like so:
  - [[pull]] [[pull links]]
  - [[pull]] [[pull nodes]]
- [[push]] doesn't exist yet, but might soon. It'll be close to its inverse.
  - Pull and push might be seen as simple versions of [[transclusion]] and [[broadcast]] respectively.
- Note that in the context of a social network like the [[Agora]] "pull requests" to a node might be related to [[ranking]].
