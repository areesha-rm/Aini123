# Pull

- An [[action]].
  - [[pull]] [[agora action]] makes sense both in [[action]] and here in pull.
- Can be used to implement broadcast, synonims, interest.
- Can provide benefits on both sides; those of the node pulling and those of the node being pulled.
  - Note that in the context of a social network like the the [[Agora]] those benefits can have real effect on the lives of people.
