# Pull

- An [[action]].
  - If you use this action, it will pull the target nodes to the current context. Like so:
    - [[pull]] [[pulled nodes]]
  - Pulling means that the target nodes show up after the node you are visiting; and said nodes show in the [[pulled]] [[links]] section.
  - There is also [[push]]. It's not currently exactly its inverse, but it's close.
  - Pull and push might be seen as implementing, or contributing to, forms of:
    - [[transclusion]]
    - [[broadcast]] 
    - [[pubsub]]
    - [[canonical forms]]
    - [[entity disambiguation]]
    - [[ranking]] 
  - Note that in the context of a social network like the [[Agora]] [[pull]] and [[push]] can be used to implement a [[ranking algorithm]].
