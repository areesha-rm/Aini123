# Pull

- An [[action]].
  - [[pull]] [[agora action]] makes sense both in [[action]] and here in pull.
- Can be used to implement broadcast, synonims, interest.
- Can provide benefits on both sides; those of the node pulling and those of the node being pulled.
  - In the context of a [[digital garden]], pull links function as a sort of inverse of the [[go]] link. They are equivalent to visiting the parameter node ("USA") and adding a go link to it pointing to the current one ("United States").
  - Note that in the context of a social network like the [[Agora]] those benefits can get to have a real life effect on people and their work; "pulling attention" is related to [[ranking]].
