- a [[letter]].
    - I wrote on [[2024-09-05]] in the [[Agora of Flancia]] just before the the cycle of lectures by [[Jigme Rinpoche]] came to an end.

Dear Jigme Rinpoche,

     Thank you for your teaching and the light of your consciousness which you kindly share, for the [[Dharma]] as you communicated it to me and others live and in your books, and for your patience as you read this letter.
