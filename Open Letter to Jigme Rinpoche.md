- a [[letter]].
    - I wrote on [[2024-09-05]] in the [[Agora of Flancia]] just before the the cycle of lectures by [[Jigme Rinpoche]] came to an end.

Dear [[Lama Jigme Rinpoche]],

Thank you for your teaching and the light of your consciousness which you kindly share, for the [[Dharma]] as you communicated it to me and others live and in your books, and for your patience as you read this letter. Please take only the time you can afford to read this, I understand if you are busy.

My name is Eduardo Ivanec and I am a householder who has been trying to follow the Bodhisattva path for some years. I am originally from Argentina, and have been living and working in Switzerland for ten years, and practicing Buddhism for nearly five with a daily meditation practice for three. The cycle of talks graciously hosted by [[Dhagpo MÃ¤nnedorf]] was the first opportunity I took to attend a Dharma event locally, and the first time I attended any event linked to your tradition. I very much appreciated receiving your teachings and will try to use what I have learned for the benefit of all beings.

As some of my fellow practitioners may have noticed, I was unable to recite the mantras of your tradition due to lack of familiarity, although I am happy to report I have been doing a form of [[Chenrezig]] practice for years without calling it as such, usually chanting the name of [[Avalokiteshvara]] and trying to visualize and embody their boundless compassion. I did only half knowing it might be standard practice with my day to day practice generally guided by the Nikayas, the Dalai Lama and others teaching within Theravada and Mahayana. Before and after I listened to your lovely voices, if I understand correctly vowing to raise Bodhicitta, practice the Brahmaviharas and embody Chenrezig, I recited some from my tradition. I intend to translate your verses and study them. During my practice, I usually invoke the names and qualities of [[Avalokiteshvara]], [[Tara]] and [[Maitreya]].

I have been reading your book and researching the [[Karma Kagyu]] school and the [[Karmapa]]. I find it inspiring how the Karmapa is engaged in vegetarianism and environmentalism. I am interested also in learning more about the efforts of [[Shamar Rinpoche]] in the field of [[Buddhism and democracy]], which is one of my greatest interests.

I have some questions that arose during the cycle of talks and I wanted to take the opportunity to ask, only if you or someone in your organization have the time to entertain them (no problem if not, of course):

- During the Dharma talks, you gave the example of visiting a market to notice the suffering of living beings and practice compassion. When doing so, how can one maximize the chances of practicing skilfull/right action, given there are many possible ways to try to help, and the world is so complex and inter-dependent? For example one could try to free all animals in the market; or convince the traders to seek other professions; or go home and join organizations for the welfare of animals, then dedicate a significant part of one's efforts to them. How can one try to make the right choice, when there are so many options and a matching opportunity cost?
- Do you know the work of Monk Taixu (1890-1947), in particular as it relates to the forming of great groups of Bodhisattavas to try to improve the world in a coordinated way and achieve a Pure Land in the Human Realm?
- Are there any communities for Bodhisattvas that you could recommend interested practitioners join, in particular maybe online in nature? I ask this because I believe in the potential of the internet to maximize the benefit of Buddhist practice on a global scale, and if such a platform does not yet exist I could contribute some of my effort to try to build it (I am a Staff Reliability Engineer, meaning an IT/computer person, and could help set up such a platform if needed).

Thank you again for your teaching and your direction.

May you be happy! May you be free from suffering! May you continue to shine for the benefit of beings!
