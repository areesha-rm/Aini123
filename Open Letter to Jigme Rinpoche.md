- a [[letter]].
    - I wrote on [[2024-09-05]] in the [[Agora of Flancia]] just before the the cycle of lectures by [[Jigme Rinpoche]] came to an end.

Dear Jigme Rinpoche,

     Thank you for your teaching and the light of your consciousness which you kindly share, for the [[Dharma]] as you communicated it to me and others live and in your books, and for your patience as you read this letter. Please take only the time you can afford to read this, I understand if you are busy.

     My name is Eduardo Ivanec and I am a householder who has decided to try follow the Bodhisattva path. I am originally from Argentina, and have been living and working in Switzerland for ten years, and practicing Buddhism for nearly five. The cycle of talks graciously hosted by the community was the first opportunity I took to attend a Dhamma event locally, though, and the first time I attended any event linked to your tradition. I very much appreciated receiving your teachings and will try to use what I have learned for the benefit of all beings.

    As my fellow practitioners may have noticed, I was unable to recite the mantras of your tradition due to lack of familiarity, although I am happy to report I have been doing a form of [[Chenrezig]] practice for years without calling it as such, usually chanting the name of [[Avalokiteshvara]] and trying to visualize and embody their boundless compassion. I did only half knowing it might be standard practice with my day to day practice generally guided by the Nikayas, the Dalai Lama and others teaching within Theravada and Mahayana. Before and after I listened to your lovely voices, if I understand correctly vowing to raise Bodhicitta, practice the Brahmaviharas and embody Chenrezig, I recited some from my tradition. I intend to translate your verses and study them. During my practice, I usually invoke the names and qualities of [[Avalokiteshvara]], [[Tara]] and [[Maitreya]].

    I have been reading about the [[Karma Kagyu]] school and the [[Karmapa]]. I find it inspiring how the Karmapa is engaged in vegetarianism and environmentalism, and the efforts of [[Shamar Rinpoche]] in the field of [[Buddhism and democracy]] seem very much aligned with my values.

    I would like to tell you a bit more about me. I am a Staff Reliability Engineer, meaning an IT/computer person.

    May you be happy! May you be free from suffering! May you shine for the benefit of beings!
