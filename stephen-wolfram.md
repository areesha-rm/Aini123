# Stephen Wolfram

- Huh, interesting that I don't have more here already.
- Listened to first podcast with [[Lex Fridman]]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez773teNFYA
  - Last half an hour in particular:
    - Might be interested in some facet of the [[Agora]]?
    - Might like [[Diaspora]] by [[Greg Egan]]?
- [[2020-11-21]] been listening to the second podcast episode with [[Lex Fridman]]. Four hours and a half long, but really good stuff. You can really feel Lex being enthusiastic about Wolfram's research.

  - Physics might indeed be different to different intelligences in the universe because their context (and scale) might be different enough so that the set of physics that is *relevant* to their being varies.
    - The speed of light could very well have been infinite. We only notice it is finite because of ping on the internet; that's the full extent that fact seems to affect our daily life.

  - 3h33m in, a great recap of [[mathematics is a graph]].
    - "There are five platonic solids" is the hardest proof in [[Euclid]]: 33 steps through axioms.
    - The graph's geometry is that of the relations between all mathematical facts. The graph's geography is the space that mathematicians happened to be able to explore.
