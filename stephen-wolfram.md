# Stephen Wolfram
- Listened to podcast with [[Lex Fridman]]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez773teNFYA
  - Last half an hour in particular:
    - Might be interested in some facet of the [[Agora]]?
    - Might like [[Diaspora]] by [[Greg Egan]]?
- [[2020-11-21]] been listening to the second episode with [[Lex Fridman]]. Four hours and a half long, but really good stuff. You can really feel Lex being enthusiastic about Wolfram's research.
