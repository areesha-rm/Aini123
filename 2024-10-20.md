- I'm liking my new [[8bitdo]] keyboard a lot, and now that I've made the programmable buttons work even more :)
  - I set one big button to lock the screen and the other to write 'yes' and press enter; I figured programming one to take a full action that *might* be dangerous in some contexts was fun and reasonable enough for what IS a big red button after all, so if you press it in front of a prompt or a chat window you should be sufficiently aware of the risk :)
  - Typing here I remember how much I like typing, in a way. Another thing I like is that it forces me away from the laptop, where the touchpad is always available. Here I have to reach for the mouse, as in the olden days, and this is a small context switch that I might be able to catch myself doing when I intended to focus on the task at hand (writing).
  - I think this might enable me to write more and in longer form, which is something I've been meaning to do for a while. The last long form text I wrote publicly was the [[Agora Chapter]] of the book about [[Personal Knowledge Graphs]], which was published in [[2023]].

I guess at some point once you've written enough you can drop the bullet points and go back to full prose, whatever difference this makes. To some extent paragraphs *are* a two level list hierarchy, in the sense that every sentence that follows a previous instead of beginning a new paragraph can be though to be a children to one that preceded it.

- I ran into [[Wittgenstein]] again and I thought again of reading him seriously/more fully, I have only read fragments of him so far and of course commentary to his work.
- I guess bullet points can serve as asides in longer form prose, like parentheses or dashes, but perhaps more readable for the case of writers which tend to produce many asides and meta :)

So, anyway, writing makes me feel good; it feels cathartic you could say, and also just necessary at times.
