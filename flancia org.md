		- The [[root]] of the project. Where it all started.
    - #git https://github.com/flancian/flancia
		- contains my #blog https://flancia.org/mine
	- It was pretty much [[unmaintained]] from early [[2020]] to [[2022]] as I focused on [[work]] (like [[Covid-19]] tech response) and building an [[Agora]].
		- I finally picked it up again on [[2022-03-26]], and then on [[2022-12-17]].
