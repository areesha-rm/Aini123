# Movies

- a [[list]].
  - [[paterson]]
  - [[passengers]]
  - [[only lovers left alive]]
  - [[roma citt√† aperta]]
- I [[like]] them but I don't watch as many as I'd like as of late.
  - It's hard to make the time for them? In particular when there's so much stuff to do, and when there are so many other media fighting for our attention.
  - [[series]] might be taking over, but honestly you can watch movies as if they were series perfectly fine -- just watch them in 23 minutes or 40 minutes stints. I'm not a fundamentalist.
