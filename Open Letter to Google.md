  - This version is [[corp only]] as I work for [[Google]] and I believe it is most ethical to work on it within the circle of trust that the corporation pays me to uphold.

# Introduction
I bet you don't run into letters with introductions every day :)

This open letter was written on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the publication of [[Google]]'s initial [[founders letter]] with the occasion of the company's [[IPO]] back on [[April 29th]], [[2004]]. Its intent is to address both the company and the internet at large as a constructive and participatory retrospective of the 20 years since, written in the spirit of [[loving kindness]], as a public individual.

As of the time of writing this letter is a [[work in progress]]. I started writing here on [[April 29th]] with the intent to have it in readable state by [[May 1st]] or the weekend (depending on how work and personal life go) -- but I have covered many of these topics elsewhere in the [[Agora]] in the form of [[notes]], so please refer to those if at all interested.


# An Agora is what Google should be
By this I mean not the [[Agora]] as it is in its current form (in which you might be reading this) -- but rather the Agora in its potential, as a set of values and intentions that I believe are closely aligned with the intent of the founders and of, I believe, many leaders through the lifetime of the company.
