# Introduction
I bet you don't run into letters with introductions every day :)

This open letter was written on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the publication of [[Google]]'s initial [[founders letter]] with the occasion of the company's [[IPO]] back on [[April 29th]], [[2004]]. Its intent is to address both the company and the internet at large as a constructive and participatory retrospective of the 20 years since for the company and the internet, written in the spirit of openness and [[loving kindness]], as a public individual.

As of the time of writing this letter is a [[work in progress]]. I started writing here on [[April 29th]] with the intent to have it in readable state by [[May 1st]] or the weekend (depending on how work and personal life go) -- but I have covered many of these topics elsewhere in the [[Agora]] in the form of [[notes]], so please refer to those if at all interested.

# An Agora is what Google should be
By this I mean not the [[Agora]] as it is in its current form (in which you might be reading this) -- but rather the Agora in its potential, as a set of values and intentions that I believe are closely aligned with the intent of the founders and of many leaders through the lifetime of the company.

I started the Agora project back in 2017-2019 (depending on how you count) to demonstrate some basic principles in the field of knowledge management that I thought were [[interesting]] and [[important]] to explore in the open. With this letter, I want to make the argument that the Agora represents a step forward in the right direction for a company like Google as it navigates the mid 20s. You will be the judge if my claims have any merit. 

If not these specific proposals, though, ask yourself: which proposals would indeed improve Google and society more than these ones? The Agora is, most of all, the intention of feeling free to write constructive proposals down and sharing them (ideally IMHO early), in any well-designated forum of your choice. 

In that spirit: if you share a proposal for the betterment of Google, I will at least add a link here. If you share a proposal for the betterment of the internet or society at large, please consider joining this Agora :)

An Agora, in short, is: free, fair and democratic. Google, being profit driven, need not be free at all times; but in this letter I make the point that, given its position relevance in the evolution of the internet, it *should* be increasingly fair and democratic within its possibilities.

# Google should consider becoming more democratic
Most corporations have historically not been democratic at all; governance wise they tend to be (or become) highly hierarchical, in particular as they age and emergent hierarchies solidify and negotiate market pressures.

Google toyed with a form of anti-hierarchy early in its lifetime, way before I joined in 2012. The story goes that Larry and Sergey thought that they could do away with (nascent but ever growing) layers of management, and decided that everyone would report directly to them. The experiment was cancelled after a few months due to the resulting overload. It made sense it would fail, even early in the lifetime of the company, as hierarchies have evolved to reduce coordination overhead and have strong points that have demonstrable evolutionary fitness in the market. My proposal here is, therefore, not that Google should immolate by becoming purely chaotic -- but rather that it should be one of the first companies in the 21st century to adopt techniques that have have demonstrably helped human groups scale beyond the limits imposed by what, organizationally speaking, amounts to a form of monarchy.

The answer to the scaling and growing pains that Google started going through in the 10s and early 20s is not, I believe, to double down on hierarchy and limit information flow as pretty much every other Traditional Company has done while facing the same problems; but rather to inch closer to what could be called [[heterarchy]],  

# Google should be fairer
Fairer to all: fairer to employees, fairer to users (a.k.a. [[people]]), fairer to society at large.

In which ways could Google be fairer? Read on for those that I thought fitting to share in public given my employment and what I think is [[right speech]] and [[right livelihood]]. Some of these I will expand in the version of this letter that is readable only to other Google employees.

# Google should be closer to free
By this I mean not that it should become a non-profit but rather that profits should not get in the way of providing good quality services to people at minimum cost.

By this I mean also that Google should adequately compensate the users for their attention.
