# Introduction
I bet you don't run into letters with introductions every day :)

This open letter was written in early [[May 2024]] with the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the [[April 29th]] publication of the [[Google]]'s [[founders letter]] prior to the its [[IPO]] on [[Aug 19]]. Its intent is to address both Google the company and the internet at large in a constructive and participatory retrospective of the collective years since this milestone, both for the company and the [[greater internet community]]. 

This letter is written in the spirit of [[openness]] and [[loving kindness]] towards all beings, as a public individual who happens to be an employee of [[Google]] as of the time of writing.

**Note** that as of the time of writing ([[2024-05-03]]) this letter and all others linked from here should be considered most definitely a [[work in progress]]. I started writing here on [[April 29th]] with the intent to have it in readable state on the first week of [[May 2024]] (depending on how work and personal life go), but I have covered many of these topics before, as fragments, elsewhere in the [[Agora]] in the form of [[nodes]]; so please refer to those if at all interested, and reach out if you have any questions or comments :).

# An [[Agora]] is what [[Google]] could be, again :)

I am writing this letter because nobody else seems to be. With the occasion of this anniversary, to me in many ways more significant for my relationship with the company than its original founding, I was hoping for both the company and the wider internet to have a conversation about what happens to be in year 20 of [[Google's]] reign as an internet search engine and provider of [[knowledge tools]].

I also write this in the context of what some call [[late stage capitalism]] but we can safely describe as [[digital capitalism]], as of [[mid 2024]]. I believe human society must take heed to examine the occasion; it seems safe and interesting to stop for a moment to consider together how the internet has evolved in the last 20 years as Google aged, and the role of [[Google]] changed in the wider societal context.

By "an Agora" and "could" I mean not the [[Agora]] and [[Google]] exactly as they are in their current form, but rather [[the Agora]] in its full potential, as per the set of values and intentions closely aligned with the intent of the founder and other participating beings, in particular by [[leaders]] at a particular stage of the lifecycle of the company and [[Agora community]].

--

I (meaning my [[self]], Eduardo a.k.a. [[Flancian]]) started the [[Agora project]] back in 2017-2019 (depending on how you count) to demonstrate some basic principles in the field of knowledge management that I thought were [[interesting]] and [[important]] to explore in the open. With this letter, I want to make the argument that the Agora represents a step forward in the right direction for a company like Google as it navigates the mid 20s. You will be the judge if my claims have any merit. 

If not these specific proposals, though, ask yourself: which proposals would indeed improve Google and society more than these ones? The Agora is, most of all, the intention of feeling free to write constructive proposals down and sharing them (ideally IMHO early), in any well-designated forum of your choice. 

In that spirit: if you share a proposal for the betterment of Google, I will at least add a link here. If you share a proposal for the betterment of the internet or society at large, please consider joining this Agora :)

An Agora, in short, is: free, fair and democratic. Google, being profit driven, need not be free at all times; but in this letter I make the point that, given its position relevance in the evolution of the internet, it *should* be increasingly fair and democratic within its possibilities.

# Google should consider becoming more democratic
Most corporations have historically not been democratic at all; governance wise they tend to be (or become) highly hierarchical, in particular as they age and emergent hierarchies solidify and negotiate market pressures.

Google toyed with a form of anti-hierarchy early in its lifetime, way before I joined in 2012. The story goes that Larry and Sergey thought that they could do away with (nascent but ever growing) layers of management, and decided that everyone would report directly to them. The experiment was cancelled after a few months due to the resulting overload. It made sense it would fail, even early in the lifetime of the company, as hierarchies have evolved to reduce coordination overhead and have strong points that have demonstrable evolutionary fitness in the market. My proposal here is, therefore, not that Google should immolate by becoming purely chaotic -- but rather that it should be one of the first companies in the 21st century to adopt techniques that have have demonstrably helped human groups scale beyond the limits imposed by what, organizationally speaking, amounts to a form of monarchy.

The answer to the scaling and growing pains that Google started going through in the 10s and early 20s is not, I believe, to double down on hierarchy and limit information flow as pretty much every other Traditional Company has done while facing the same problems; but rather to inch closer to what could be called [[heterarchy]], in my proposal gradually adopting principles of [[liquid democracy]]. 

# Google should be fairer
Fairer to all: fairer to employees, fairer to users (a.k.a. [[people]]), fairer to society at large.

In which ways could Google be fairer? Read on for those that I thought fitting to share in public given my employment and what I think is [[right speech]] and [[right livelihood]]. Some of these I will expand in the version of this letter that is readable only to other Google employees.

# Google should be closer to free
By this I mean not that it should become a non-profit but rather that profits should not get in the way of providing good quality services to people at minimum cost. By this I mean alternatively that Google should adequately compensate the users for their attention.

This might surprise you, but I think Google has been able to stay relatively close to this promise that seems very core to its original mission ([[to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful]]). Still, we could do better even.

# How the Agora factors into all of this
The Agora project is my personal proposal, developed as [[free software]] and in the open, for how to solve the problems that ail both Google and the internet at large as they grow, age and learn.

The Agora, being a [[commons]], contains a minimum viable governance platform: a space for debate and group decision making coupled with individual exploration.

The Agora puts the user first -- at least some users :) It is currently relatively user unfriendly, but this is because it's a work in progress. Even at this early stage, it does put the user first in two key ways.

First of all, it tries to make it easy to explore alternatives. The 'web results' bar that shows up just below the query tries to link out directly to as many useful sites as we can reasonably show to a visiting user. As of the time of writing Google is highlighted because I still believe it is the best search engine in the internet; and Marginalia is highlighted as a good (and distinct/quirkly fun) fully free/independent alternative.

Second of all, it always has the Wikipedia article up top if one is found. Enough said, I believe? :)

Third of all: after that, what we show is exactly what the users have literally written -- meaning both full Agora users (people who sign up to contribute notes) and social media users. 

Being that users have a way to influence all three of the ways listed above, I believe it is sufficiently proven that the Agora puts the user first.
