# Introduction
I bet you don't run into letters with introductions every day :)

This open letter was written in early [[May 2024]] with the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the [[April 29th]] publication of the [[Google]]'s [[founders letter]] prior to the its [[IPO]] on [[Aug 19]]. Its intent is to address both Google the company and the internet at large in a constructive and participatory retrospective of the collective years since this milestone, both for the company and the [[greater internet community]]. 

This letter is written in the spirit of [[openness]] and [[loving kindness]] towards all beings, as a public individual who happens to be an employee of [[Google]] as of the time of writing.

**Note** that as of the time of writing ([[2024-05-03]]) this letter and all others linked from here should be considered most definitely a [[work in progress]]. I started writing here on [[April 29th]] with the intent to have it in readable state on the first week of [[May 2024]] (depending on how work and personal life go), but I have covered many of these topics before, as fragments, elsewhere in the [[Agora]] in the form of [[nodes]]; so please refer to those if at all interested, and reach out if you have any questions or comments :).

# An [[Agora]] is what [[Google]] could be, again :)

I am writing this letter because nobody else seems to be. With the occasion of this anniversary, to me in many ways more significant for my relationship with the company than its original founding, I was hoping for both the company and the wider internet to have a conversation about what happens to be in year 20 of [[Google's]] reign as an internet search engine and provider of [[knowledge tools]].

I also write this in the context of what some call [[late stage capitalism]] but we can safely describe as [[digital capitalism]] as it is in [[mid 2024]]. I hope company and wider society can recognize the opportunity to reflect on the occasion; it seems appropriate to stop for a moment and consider together how the internet has evolved in the last 20 years as Google and other tech companies aged (and learnt, and grew), and their roles shifted in the wider societal context.

By "an Agora" and "could" I mean not the [[Agora]] and [[Google]] exactly as they are in their current form, but rather their full potential, as per the set of values and intentions closely aligned with the intent of the [[founders]] and [[leaders]] at a particular stage of the lifecycle of [[company]] or [[community]].

--

With this letter, I want to make the argument that the Agora represents a step forward in the right direction for a company like Google as it navigates the mid 20s. You will be the judge if the merit of my claims; I welcome, always, all feedback.

This letter contains, in as succinct a way as I could muster, a series of specific proposals to [[Google]] and the community of [[users]]. Whenever I couldn't expound in full, I will try to include [[links]].

As you read them, please keep in mind this: if not these proposals, which would you make? If you want, ask yourself: which proposals would indeed improve a tech company of your choice more than these ones? 


In that spirit: if you share a proposal for the betterment of Google, I will at least add a link here. If you share a proposal for the betterment of the internet or society at large, please consider joining this Agora :)

## What the Agora and Google are

An Agora, in short, is a pro-social device which tries to be [[free]], [[fair]] for the community (its "users"): put another way, it is a [[Commons]]. 

Google is a corporation and a community of employees (traditionally "Googlers", assumed to be practicing "Googlyness" :) In this letter, we will comment on how Google was and how Google is, and what Google could be (again?). 

Being mostly profit driven as of the time of writing, Google need not be free at all times; but in this letter I make the argument that, given its position of relevance and control at this stage of the evolution of the [[first known internet]], it *should* try to become increasingly fair ("democratic") within available market-reality-bound possibilities.

## Google should experiment again with being more democratic
Most corporations have historically not been democratic at all; governance wise they tend to be (or become) highly hierarchical, in particular as they age and emergent hierarchies solidify and negotiate market pressures. As far as governmental structures go, companies are stuck in the time of [[kings]] and [[feudalism]].

Google toyed with a form of anti-hierarchy early in its lifetime, way before I joined in 2012. The story goes that Larry and Sergey thought that they could do away (relatively still few but ever growing) layers of management, and decided that everyone would report directly to one of them -- I think it was Sergey (I will, of course, check). The experiment was cancelled after a few months due to the resulting overload and dysfunction. It seems to me that it makes sense it failed, even that early in the lifecycle of the company. Hierarchies seem to have evolved to reduce coordination overhead and they have strong points which yield demonstrable evolutionary fitness. 

My proposal here is that Google should experiment again with some of the concepts and strategies it explored around the time the original [[founders letter]] was published, instead of becoming yet another profit-driven not-putting-users-first in [[digital capitalism]]. I am not suggesting it should risk immolation by becoming chaotic or straying away from market expectations altogether. Rather that it should dare to be one of the first companies of this 21st century to learn from governance tools that have have demonstrably helped other human groups scale beyond the obvious limits imposed by what -- again, organizationally speaking -- amounts to an early form of monarchy.

I started the Agora because I believe that the answer to the scaling, growing, aging pains that Google (and other tech corporations) went through in the [[last twenty years]] is *not* to double down on hierarchy, cease to put the user first, focus on maximizing profits while bowing down to market and government pressure and becoming informationally-opaque -- as any "[[traditional company]]" would do. 

I joined Google in [[2012]] thinking the [[founders]] cared about the health of the internet and the good of society ahead of profits, and showed it through their public actions and their treatment of employees and users. 

**Note** but rather to inch closer to what could be called [[heterarchy]], in my proposal gradually adopting principles of [[liquid democracy]]. 

# Google should be fairer
Fairer to all: fairer to employees, fairer to users (a.k.a. [[people]]), fairer to society at large.

In which ways could Google be fairer? Read on for those that I thought fitting to share in public given my employment and what I think is [[right speech]] and [[right livelihood]]. Some of these I will expand in the version of this letter that is readable only to other Google employees.

# Google should be closer to free
By this I mean not that it should become a non-profit but rather that profits should not get in the way of providing good quality services to people at minimum cost. By this I mean alternatively that Google should adequately compensate the users for their attention.

This might surprise you, but I think Google has been able to stay relatively close to this promise that seems very core to its original mission ([[to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful]]). Still, we could do better even.

# How the Agora factors into all of this
The Agora project is my personal proposal, developed as [[free software]] and in the open, for how to solve the problems that ail both Google and the internet at large as they grow, age and learn.

The Agora, being a [[commons]], contains a minimum viable governance platform: a space for debate and group decision making coupled with individual exploration.

The Agora puts the user first -- at least some users :) It is currently relatively user unfriendly, but this is because it's a work in progress. Even at this early stage, it does put the user first in two key ways.

First of all, it tries to make it easy to explore alternatives. The 'web results' bar that shows up just below the query tries to link out directly to as many useful sites as we can reasonably show to a visiting user. As of the time of writing Google is highlighted because I still believe it is the best search engine in the internet; and Marginalia is highlighted as a good (and distinct/quirkly fun) fully free/independent alternative.

Second of all, it always has the Wikipedia article up top if one is found. Enough said, I believe? :)

Third of all: after that, what we show is exactly what the users have literally written -- meaning both full Agora users (people who sign up to contribute notes) and social media users. 

Being that users have a way to influence all three of the ways listed above, I believe it is sufficiently proven that the Agora puts the user first.
