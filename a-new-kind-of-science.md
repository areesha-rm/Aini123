# A New Kind of Science

- Heavily critized book by [[stephen wolfram]], mostly (IIUC) for the way his ego gets in the way. I've heard/read the following:
  - He often doesn't seem to care about previous work in the field.
  - He often seems to claim authorship of known concepts. 
  - He's sued people for publishing proofs that he considered a "industry secret" (of [[wolfram research]]).
- [[criticism]] http://bactra.org/reviews/wolfram/ is a scathing classic by [[cosma shalizi]].
