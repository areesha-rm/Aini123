# A New Kind of Science

- [[go]] https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/
- Heavily critized book by [[stephen wolfram]], mostly (IIUC) for the way his ego gets in the way. I've heard/read the following:
  - He often doesn't seem to care about previous work in the field.
  - He often seems to claim authorship of known concepts. 
- [[criticism]] http://bactra.org/reviews/wolfram/ is a scathing classic.
