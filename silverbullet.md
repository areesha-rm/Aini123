## Getting started

I started using [[silver bullet]] on [[February 2024]] and I think I'm not going back to what I was using before except when I really need terminal editing ([[wiki vim]] remains my choice in that environment).

I thought I'd keep a node here detailing what I had to do to turn it into a good [[Agora editor]] for my existing [[digital garden]]. Not much, it turns out!
