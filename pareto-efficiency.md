# Pareto Efficiency

- [[go]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency
  - [[quote]] Given an initial situation, a Pareto improvement is a new situation where some agents will gain, and no agents will lose.
  - A situation is called Pareto dominated if there exists a possible Pareto improvement.
  - A situation is called Pareto optimal or Pareto efficient if no change could lead to improved satisfaction for some agent without some other agent losing or if there's no scope for further Pareto improvement.
