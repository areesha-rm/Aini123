* [[Maitreya]]!
  - Maitreya on Saturday is extra special
- [[Burup]]
  - I played the piano, I'm enjoying recording midis while practicing even if it's sometimes cacophonic -- as it sometimes isn't :) and saving the midi seems interesting and would let me extract fragments later
- [[Fediverse]]
  - Had a conversation with [[foolishowl]]
- Wrote [[practice.py]] on a lark :)
