# Federation

- [[push]] [[fediverse]]
  - a [[subset]] of the [[internet]].
    - The part that is willing to [[federate]]. 
    - The part that works for its [[users]].
    - The set of all [[open platforms]]; those which respect [[open protocols]].
- [[go]] https://fediverse.party/en/portal/servers
  - I heartily recommend you choose an [[instance]] of any type (there are many) and join now. Prioritize this in particular if you're hooked with platforms such as [[instagram]] or [[twitter]].
- The [[agora]] is part of the [[federation]].
  - It tries to run projects of [[public utility]].
