# Agora Twitter Integration

- [[pull]] [[agora social media integration]]
- [[Twitter]] could integrate with the [[Agora]], or the other way around, in several seemingly productive ways.
- One way would be to automatically pull tweets that use [[wikilink]]s as backlinks in the matching node.

  - Probably should support scheduling, throttling, etc.
- The [[agora]] will also auto-embed tweets by default. The following is a [[demo]].
