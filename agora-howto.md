# Agora Howto

 - [[go]] https://github.com/flancian/agora/blob/master/docs/howto.md
  - (If you see nodes that have a block beginning with go, they refer to go links. anagora.org/go/node redirects to the URL in that line. Example: https://flancia.org/go/agora-howto).
 - [[todo]] Should be a high level walkthrough from zero to "you know how to navigate the Agora" and "you have a digital garden and you know how to integrate it into the Agora if you are willing".
