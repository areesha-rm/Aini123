- An [[essay]].

You might have heard the [[news]]: [[Google]] lays off [[12000]]. In the meantime the company has over [[100 billion]] in the bank.

The time has come to ask ourselves: what if [[Moloch]] took Google?

Under what is watch Google was taken maybe, in many worse than average timelines. With this I mean: Google as a corporation is both good and bad -- prosocial and antisocial in turns -- like all human groups, and maybe more generally all cybernetic groups (of humans thinking with computers). As a corporation in [[late stage capitalism]], it has developed in an environment that rewards profit seeking. But note that, like many corporations of Silicon Valley, its core ideas came from people with an academic background, and its cultural DNA was seeded and nurtured by interesting people who overall wanted to disrupt the world positively, contributing [[towards the democratization of knowledge]].

- Not the problem with what Google is doing is the fucking [[mediocrity]] of it all, which goes against its self-proclaimed culture.
- About alternate deals as grownups.
  - Insert meme: [[I have altered the deal]].
