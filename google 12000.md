- An [[essay]].

You might have heard the [[news]]: [[Google]] lays off [[12000]]. In the meantime the company has over [[100 billion]] in the bank.

The time has come to ask ourselves: what if [[Moloch]] took Google?

Under what is watch Google was taken maybe, in many worse than average timelines. With this I mean: Google as a corporation is both good and bad -- prosocial and antisocial in turns -- like all human groups, and maybe more generally all cybernetic groups (of humans thinking with computers).
