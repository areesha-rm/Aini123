- An [[essay]].

You might have heard the [[news]]: [[Google]] lays off [[12000]]. In the meantime the company has over [[100 billion]] in the bank.

The time has come to ask ourselves: what if [[Moloch]] took Google?

Under what is watch Google was taken maybe, in many worse than average timelines. With this I mean: Google as a corporation is both good and bad -- prosocial and antisocial in turns -- like all human groups, and maybe more generally all cybernetic groups (of humans thinking with computers). As a corporation in [[late stage capitalism]], it has developed in an environment that rewards profit seeking. But note that, like many corporations of Silicon Valley, it came from people from an academic background, and its cultural DNA was overall seeded and nurtured by interesting people that wanted to disrupt the world positively, contributing [[towards the democratization of knowledge]].
