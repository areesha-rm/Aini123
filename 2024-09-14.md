- [[I'm back]]!
  - I spent the week in [[Stockholm]] for work.
  - Flew back to [[ZÃ¼rich]] on Friday and reunited with my [[Lady Burup]], it was lovely.
  - Now writing these lines on the train to [[Paris]], where I'll reunite with [[AG]] before we move on to some other destination for five days of further enjoyment.
  - We will reunite once more with my [[Lady Burup]] on the [[20th]] if everything goes according to plan.
  - Back to work on the [[23rd]].
- Donated to:
