		- "Hopscotch is a [[stream-of-consciousness]] [[novel]] which can be read according to two different sequences of [[chapters]]. This novel is often referred to as a [[counter-novel]], as it was by Cortázar himself. It meant an exploration with multiple endings, a [[neverending search]] through unanswerable questions."
