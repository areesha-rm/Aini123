# Google

- As of [[2020-12-12]] I work for Google. I have done so for eight years.
- A good employer.
  - My coworkers tend to be great-to-amazing.
  - Compensation is good. 
  - Many of the company's products are useful.
- I'm not a huge fan of ads *but* I think that showing/seeing ads in exchange of free services is a *reasonable* proposition, when it's clear.
  - It'd be better if it was always optional.
