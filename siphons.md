# Siphons

- [[pull]] [[siphon]]
- Wherever there is [[user data]], data that belongs to the users but is kept hostage by a corporation, [[siphons]] enable users to claim back control of their data.
- [[moa]] could be a platform that hosts [[siphons]].
- With many siphons we could build [[flanbook]]. Or the [[social network]] of your choice: a [[ctzn]] heavily connected to the rest of the internet.
- [[markdown on git]] and [[wikilinks everywhere]] play a part here.
