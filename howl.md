# Howl

- a [[poem]]

  - I saw [[the best minds of my generation]] destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,
dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,
angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night
  - [[Moloch]] whose soul is [[electricity]] and [[banks]]!
