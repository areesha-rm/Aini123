# I like static

Sometimes I run into software or hardware [[glitches]] that cause static. Like when you hit an audio bug; I had pulseaudio somehow introduce a weird feedback like effect while I was playing music a few weeks ago. Or perhaps compression artifacts get amplified; or noise cancelling doesn't quite get it right during a video call. It just happened while we were listening to [[roxanne gay]] on [[instagram]].
