# Know Your Amphetamines

- An [[essay]].
- [[by]] [[scott alexander]]
- [[go]] https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/know-your-amphetamines
  - about [[amphetamines]] as a treatment for [[add]]/[[adhd]] and their history
  - [[adderall]] is essentially a weird rebranded [[amphetamine]] cocktail from the 50s
  - [[dexedrine]] > [[adderall]]
  - [[desoxyn]] potentially beats [[dexedrine]], but is [[meth]]
  - [[evekeo]] doesn't make a lot of sense
