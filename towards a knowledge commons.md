In particular I believe that we are entering a renaissance of the internet that will enable it to deliver on the promise of a distributed commons that somewhat stalled in the last fifteen years due to the success of [[anti disintermediation]] as effected by interested parties. But hopefully you won't have to take my belief at face value; let me try to show you why I believe what I believe.
