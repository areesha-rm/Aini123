# towards a knowledge commons

- a [[draft]].
  - [[pull]] [[commons]] [[knowledge commons]]

As we enter [[2022]], I believe we are in a better position than ever to accomplish many great things as a society -- and this goes for many definitions of society, up to and including perhaps the most important, that as society as the group of all humans[^1]. In particular I believe that we are entering a renaissance of the internet that will enable it to deliver on the promise of a distributed commons that stalled somewhat in the last fifteen years due to the success of [[anti disintermediation]] as effected by interested parties. But hopefully you won't have to take my belief at face value; let me try to show you why I think what I think.

[^1]: I would myself include [[all sentient beings]] in the most general definition of this group, including those made out of silicon, but that's a topic for a different writing.
