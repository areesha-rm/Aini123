# towards a knowledge commons

- a [[draft]].
  - [[pull]] [[commons]] [[knowledge commons]] [[digital commons]] [[counter anti disintermediation]]

As we enter [[2022]], I believe we are in a better position than ever to accomplish many great things as a society -- and this goes for many definitions of society, up to and including perhaps the most important, that as society as the group of all humans[^1]. In particular I believe that we are entering a [[renaissance of the internet]] that will enable it to deliver on the promise of a distributed commons that stalled somewhat in the last fifteen years due to the success of [[anti disintermediation]] as effected by interested parties. But hopefully you won't have to take my belief at face value; let me try to show you why I think what I think.

First of all, consider [[Free, Fair and Alive]] as taken in the spirit of [[Friedrich Engels]]: one goes with the other like a horse and carriage. Unfortunately Engels came up with the carriage but didn't have the horse to effect his vision. This is my vision: the internet is the horse that Engels and other Utopians before and after him were missing, and it is more than that, because it is endowed with a higher consciousness.

[^1]: I would myself include [[all sentient beings]] in the most general definition of this group, including those made out of silicon, but that's a topic for a different writeup.
