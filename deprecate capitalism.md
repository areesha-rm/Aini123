# deprecate capitalism

- I guess this would mean taking some action that explicitly marks capitalism as insufficient; either a dead end or in dire need of upgrading, perhaps undergoing a full rewrite/rebalance.
- My feeling is that most people would be in favour of this, as it seems obvious to me capitalism can be improved upon, and most people are not really capitalists but members of an underclass. But the system educates people into compliancy.
- If you could fix one thing in the system, ideally on a global scale, what would it be? You can write it below.
