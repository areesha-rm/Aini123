- I woke up with a headache for some reason, and it came back during the day, but otherwise I was fine.
- I worked and then attended the [[end of year dinner]] with my coworkers.
  - There was also a [[bowling]] afternoon event which I skipped as I felt I was too behind work and I wanted to use the opportunity to catch up.
