- I woke up with a headache for some reason, and it came back during the day, but otherwise I was fine.
- I worked and then attended the [[end of year dinner]] with my coworkers.
  - There was also a [[bowling]] afternoon event which I skipped as I felt I was too behind work and I wanted to use the opportunity to catch up.
  - Even as I decided to skip it I knew that, with the passage time, I would remember the bowling event but not the afternoon working. But I decided to do it anyway as I also knew my mental state would be affected by not making progress on some tasks, and I think in the end it was a reasonable choice.
