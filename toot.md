# Toot


- a [[command line]] [[client]] for [[mastodon]].
  - [[pull]] [[toot cli]]
  - [[go]] https://github.com/ibahunek/toot
  - [[docs]] https://toot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
  - `toot tui` brings up a console client; supports vim keys for moving, but lacks some navigations affordances still (could be a good contribution)
- the equivalent of a [[tweet]] in [[mastodon]].
  - yeah, we know it's silly. you can get used to it I guess.
  - or just say [[post]].
