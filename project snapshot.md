# project snapshot

- a [[project]]
  - to [[automate]] myself.
  - it currently consists in simple scripts that integrate available tooling to record digital snapshots of my computer's contents: the windows I had open, in which workspace, running what -- which browsers with which tabs, which editors with which opened notes.
- [[meta]]
  - Ha, I thought I had noded this long ago? That's weird.
  - Oh, interesting, it was as a [[pushed]] subnode so I didn't see it in [[foam]]. This surfaces the annoyance that foam is not [[agora protocol aware]]
  - (Well, the whole of [[agora protocol]] is meta really, but this second level I guess.)

The idea is to have a simple way for users, initially perhaps knowledge workers but with an intent for user friendliness, to be able to store and restore digital workspaces: contexts they were operating on when working on a particular task, say, and could be usefully restore to resume working on the same task or a continuation. 

I would like to support all OS/distribution/device types but I started with what I use. I intend to dedicate work to integrating tools that help users achieve this goal in whichever way they want, no matter the kind of device they are operating on. For this purpose I'm developing the [[agora]]: to facilitate the exchange of [[gardens]], [[siphons]] and [[bridges]] that integrate all contexts that users are willing to share with others.
