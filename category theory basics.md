- a [[class]]
	- on [[2021-05-30]]

Idea of what [[category theory]] is. Basic definition of mathematical concepts.

Notions that are important in category theory. Commutative diagrams; categories as kinds of [[context]]. At the end, how this fits in a bigger picture.

Aside: I'm reading Feynman and this fits in amazingly well with the introduction of that book, six easy pieces.

An [[elegant framework]] for reasoning about situations where we are composing stuff together. [[modeling]], [[computation]].

Category theory is about [[composing stuff]] together.

Example: composing [[journeys]].

![[Pasted image 20210530135755.png]]

Example: composing processes. Mathematical functions, algorithms, physical processes.

Notation: boxes instead of arrows. Directionality is from left to right.

![[Pasted image 20210530135906.png]]

The output of the first box is the same [[type]] as the input of the second.

You can also compose physical components, of course.

And physical processes.

The fundamental example is mathematical; composing functions as sets.

Aside: we should put this on youtube.

We'll be used 'then' notations for compositions, not traditional.

We'll relate [[objects]]. The things doing the relating are [[morphisms]].

(here there should be a better screenshot, I couldn't get it on time)

Each morphism has a [[source]] and a [[target]].

We can compose morphisms when the target of the first matches the source of the second.

Common feature of all examples: they are a[[associative]]. The order of *composition* doesn't matter; the order of application may. (check)

This was [[true]] for all the examples we looked at so far.

Associativity means that brackets are not needed.

Aside: going from a class in real time to screenshots is one morphism; going from screenshots to notes is another. Going from notes to a chapter or blog post is another.

Associativiy in plugs:

Identity morphisms: morphisms that do nothing. Like a zero in addition.

Identity morphism for functions: the identity function.

![[Pasted image 20210530140955.png]]

A converter that converts to the same electrical standard is just an extension that can become a converter of any type with one additional composition.

[[identity journeys]] (aside: I call these [[excursions]])

![[Pasted image 20210530141124.png]]

Mathematical notion of a category

![[Pasted image 20210530141159.png]]

Aside: I think most concepts had been introduced before except one?

"F is a morphism from X to Y":

![[Pasted image 20210530141245.png]]

Identity morphisms:

![[Pasted image 20210530141302.png]]

Composition:

![[Pasted image 20210530141330.png]]

Unitality: identity "works" (I think this was the concept I thought hadn't been defined previously):

![[Pasted image 20210530141404.png]]

The [[category of sets and functions]] plays a central role in category.
