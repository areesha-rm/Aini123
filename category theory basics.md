Idea of what [[category theory]] is. Basic definition of mathematical concepts.

Notions that are important in category theory. Commutative diagrams; categories as kinds of [[context]]. At the end, how this fits in a bigger picture.

Aside: I'm reading Feynman and this fits in amazingly well with the introduction of that book, six easy pieces.

An [[elegant framework]] for reasoning about situations where we are composing stuff together. [[modeling]], [[computation]].

Category theory is about [[composing stuff]] together.

Example: composing [[journeys]].

Example: composing processes. Mathematical functions, algorithms, physical processes.

Notation: boxes instead of arrows. Directionality is from left to right.

The output of the first box is the same [[type]] as the input of the second.

You can also compose physical components, of course.

And physical processes.

The fundamental example is mathematical; composing functions as sets.

Aside: we should put this on youtube.

We'll be used 'then' notations for compositions, not traditional.

We'll relate [[objects]]. The things doing the relating are [[morphisms]].

(here there should be a better screenshot, I couldn't get it on time)

Each morphism has a [[source]] and a [[target]].

We can compose morphisms when the target of the first matches the source of the second.

Common feature of all examples: they are a[[associative]].
