# Command Line Interface

- I love command line interfaces.
- [[in the beginning was the command line]].
- [[agora-plan]]: the [[agora]] will have a command line interface.


[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[in the beginning was the command line]: in-the-beginning-was-the-command-line "In the Beginning Was the Command Line"
[agora-plan]: agora-plan "Agora Plan"
[agora]: agora "Agora"
