  - "The Alternative Left Entertainment [[collective]] exists to produce and promote informative, entertaining, left-wing media. We are committed to the [[common good]] and the [[emancipation of all peoples]] from oppression, in particular the immiseration and despair imposed by [[Capitalism]]. We have occasionally been known to hit on a joke or two."
