# transition town

- a [[place]]
  - or [[grassroot]] [[community project]]
  - [[wp]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_town
    - based around local self-managed communities
    - [[alternate currencies]]
      - these remind me a bit of [[club del trueque]] currency in [[argentina]]
      - [[totnes pound]]
      - [[lewes pound]]
      - [[stroud pound]]
      - [[brixton pound]]
    - big in the UK
      - [[totnes]] serves as inspiration
      - [[transition network]] is a UK charity
    - there's a focus on [[peak oil]] -- I had almost forgotten about the concept. is it happening? I get the feeling peak oil is always in the imminent future but we keep missing deadlines.
  - I'm personally interested in the digital aspects of such projects -- in particular as they become networked. 
    - It seems to me the internet makes virtual transition towns possible, and perhaps useful as a metaphor, although I wonder what the people actually involved on actual transition towns would think of this idea (as the focus seems to be on local development and sustainability).
