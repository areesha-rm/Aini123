# Pomodoro Technique

- [[pull]] [[pomodoro]]
- [[go]] tomato-timer.com
  - 25 minutes work, 5 minutes rest, then every n cycles a longer rest.
- We sometimes do 'longer pomodoros' which I call [[beefsteak]]:
  - 50 minutes work, 10 minutes rest.
  - Best for activities where you need longer to fully get into deep focus, like programming.
