- a [[chapter]].
  - part of [[pkg book]] if I write it to a good standard before [[2022-09-01]] :)
    - or maybe [[2022-10-30]] ;)
    - after great comments by [[editors]].
  - #pull [[agora pkg chapter]] is the source of truth for the draft
  -     maybe I'll make that a [[meta node]] and keep this node focused strictly on the text that will be printed?
  - #pull [[agora doc]] is what will be the actual next deliverable
    - this [[google doc]] will be used for editing after [[2022-09-01]], I want to set up sync.
      - [ ] try to set up sync using [[pandoc]]

Some loose notes about the process of writing/editing this follow, started on [[2022-10-27]] as I'm starting to go through editors' comments to try to get the chapter into a good enough shape to call it done.

First of all, it's super useful and informative (a learning experience) to have professional editors go through the document. Regardless of the outcome I'm glad I get to have this experience!

Second of all, I procrastinated a bit on starting to go through comments due to a pretty irrational sense of fear that the chapter was unreadable/unrepairable. I think it turns out there's plenty to be saved and repurposed for the final draft :) I'm also happy that I took some days off work, as it is indeed the time to dedicate real time to this project in a relatively uninterrupted way.
