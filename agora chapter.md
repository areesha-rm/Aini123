Some loose notes about the process of writing/editing this follow, started on [[2022-10-27]] as I'm starting to go through editors' comments to try to get the chapter into a good enough shape to call it done.

First of all, it's super useful and informative (a learning experience) to have professional editors go through the document. Regardless of the outcome I'm glad I get to have this experience!

Second of all, I procrastinated a bit on starting to go through comments due to a pretty irrational sense of fear that the chapter was unreadable/unrepairable. I think it turns out there's plenty to be saved and repurposed for the final draft :) I'm also happy that I took some days off work, as it is indeed the time to dedicate real time to this project in a relatively uninterrupted way.

I wonder if anagora.org supports rulers yet or I just dreamt it?

----

Maybe if they are four minuses?

Nope, doesn't work, need to add this to Marko or maybe consider moving to the [[markdown parser]] that [[peter kaminski]] recommended in the last [[fellowship of the link]].

Anyway, here I am in [[2022-10-28]] doing pomodoros to try to finish the first pass over all the interesting comments by the [[editors]], end to end over the [[20 pages]] of the document.

Also planning to cook something simple tonight and have a quick dinner with friends :)

## ----

Back on [[2022-11-04]], still pretending that horizontal rulers render in the Agora :)

Tonight I want to reintroduce filenames to make screenshots better.

Then tour the Agora, taking screenshots and writing in [[bugs]].

## ----

[[Five minutes of rest]], so I write here :)

Loving [[termdown]] shaped into my simple [[pomodoro]] script.

Meditating every rest, at least three breaths (~33 seconds).

I got derailed trying to stream myself work in [[yoga with x]]. Having fun in the process, but I must not fool around now too much; I don't want the day to be derailed. 

It is currently [[2022-11-06]] [[15:20]]. I'll now shoot for [[eight pomodoros]] on top of the four we've done so far :)

## ⸎

On it then. First pomodoro ticking, 15m to go.
