- a [[chapter]].
  - part of [[pkg book]] if I write it to a good standard before [[2022-09-01]] :)
  - #pull [[agora pkg chapter]] is the draft, maybe I'll make that a [[meta node]] and keep this node focused strictly on the text that will be printed.
  - #pull [[agora doc]] is the [[google doc]] that will be used for editing after [[2022-09-01]], I want to set up sync.
    - [ ] try to set up sync using [[pandoc]]
    - #pull https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DXJRDh9Ss5VCRBi3oirDw9d7yjn3H2hMqfN2ETTyjIc/edit#heading=h.lxyhsegwtr4m
      - [x] should work, try iframe for the [[google doc]]
        - it doesn't work :( "Google Docs ben√∂tigt Zugriff"
            - oh, but you can click on "click here" to get through!
