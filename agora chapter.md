  - See also [[agora pkg chapter]], [[agora doc]].
  - #meta [[agora doc]] is what will be the actual next deliverable
    - this [[google doc]] has been used for editing rounds after [[2022-09-01]].
      - I'd like to set up sync back to the Agora ([[Markdown]]).

      - [ ] Try to set up sync on the other direction using [[pandoc]]?

Some loose notes about the process of writing/editing this follow, started on [[2022-10-27]] as I'm starting to go through editors' comments to try to get the chapter into a good enough shape to call it done.

First of all, it's super useful and informative (a learning experience) to have professional editors go through the document. Regardless of the outcome I'm glad I get to have this experience!

Second of all, I procrastinated a bit on starting to go through comments due to a pretty irrational sense of fear that the chapter was unreadable/unrepairable. I think it turns out there's plenty to be saved and repurposed for the final draft :) I'm also happy that I took some days off work, as it is indeed the time to dedicate real time to this project in a relatively uninterrupted way.

I wonder if anagora.org supports rulers yet or I just dreamt it?
