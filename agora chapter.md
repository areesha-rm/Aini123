  - part of [[pkg book]] if I write it to a good standard before [[2022-09-01]] :)
  - #pull [[agora pkg chapter]] is the draft, maybe I'll make that a [[meta node]] and keep this node focused strictly on the text that will be printed.
  - #pull [[agora doc]] is the [[google doc]] that will be used for editing after [[2022-09-01]], I want to set up sync.
    - [ ] try to set up sync using [[pandoc]]
