- an [[extension]].
  - there's a lot of [[plugin managers]] for [[vim]] but I tend to use [[vundle]] as it seems to work fine for me, and my .vimrc has all the 'Plugin' directives already.
  - in a new machine, I just need to do:

```
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

And then in vim/[[nvim]]: `:PluginInstall`
