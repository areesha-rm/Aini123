# M Prime

- a [[thought experiment]].
  - [[shorthand]] for a [[framework]] for world building.
    - I want to experiment with this in the [[agora]].
  - Take a [[model of the world]], call it [[m]]. It is a point in high dimensional [[protopoi]] space.
  - The morphism [[m prime]] results from applying well-defined transforms, alterations, procedures over [[m]].
    - These transformations, in order, form a [[path]] between [[m]] and [[m prime]] in a connected graph.
    - More than one path might link [[m]] and [[m prime]]. 
    - Intermediate steps are valid models. 
    - Transformations can be modeled as having attributes like [[cost]], [[feasibility]], [[probability]], [[pros]], [[cons]].
      - This is best done as evaluated by a [[diverse community of modelers]].
