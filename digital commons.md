# digital commons

- a [[thing]].
  - [[pull]] [[commons]] [[digital]]
    - the [[internet]] provides the ability to construct an essentially infinite number of [[digital commons]] by definition as long and as far as you allow copying.
      - this is why I am against reductions of [[copyright]] in general.
    - whatever can be copied for free can be freely shared and is thus part of the [[commons]].
- a [[list]].
  - the [[agora]].
