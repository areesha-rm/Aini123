# digital commons

- a [[place]].
  - #pull [[knowledge commons]] [[digital]] [[commons]]
    - the [[internet]] provides us with the ability to construct an essentially infinite number of [[digital commons]] by definition as long and as far as you allow (that is, do not encumber) [[copying]].
      - this is why I am against [[copyright]] in general.
      - whatever can be copied for free can be freely shared and is thus trivially part of the [[commons]].
- a [[list]].
  - (you can #push examples here or write them in the [[stoa]] below).
  - an [[agora]].
