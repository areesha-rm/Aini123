	- [[dan whaley]] starts with the [[25 years question]]: really durable technologies last >25y. web has that; wikis are almost there. What's most important to think about note taking?
		- [[oliver sauter]] anything that lasts 25y requires sustained effort. an ability to iterate towards this.
		- [[conaw]] what's motivating the question? there seems to be an unspoken assumption that web/wiki technology is 25y old.
			- [[dan whaley]] what would define the note taking apps we use in 25y? what's most important about what we're about to build?
			- [[conor]] durability is an interesting idea: we are all benefitting from vannevar bush's [[memex]] and the mother of all demos.
				- web of alexandria (sp?): most durable knowledge storage is dna. it is constantly propagating.
				- roam exports to json and md to make data durable/portable.
				- memory diamonds (?)
		- [[ward cunningham]] certainly decentralization is needed. json is nice -- they claim it's not going to be versioned.
			- we wanted to do *work* in the wiki instead of just writing about it. we wanted to bundle data and processes.
			- different kinds of things got different markup -- we tried keeping the number of markups to a minimum.
		- [[conor white-sullivan]] keeping links outside the file will
		- [[junyu zhan]] predicting the future is hard but we can learn from history. let's take the web: why is it still around?
			- it's open
			- it's accessible to everyone
			- it evolves -- we have better browsers and protocols than before but the content remains
			- note taking applications will always change; but the data will be around for a long time.
		- [[bastien guerry]] git has been quite a change. it'll be 25y old in 9y :) versioning will be pervasive; perhaps git is the right infrastructure.
		- [[flancian]] "seeding" or bootstrapping problem. inclusivity, strength through diversity. cooperative efforts. effective altruism.
