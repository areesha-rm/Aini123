  - Feedback: having a dictionary in VSCode would be useful.
  - Solution: ctrl-p, copy/paste: ext install yzhang.dictionary-completion

  - Solution: set a default somehow? Need to look into this.

  - Some people whose opinion he trusts have issues with his personality.
  - Mathematically he does not know much about what his current research is focused on.
- [[bodhisattva vow]].
- Set [[auto-commit messages]] in [[foam]] with https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39445199/how-to-make-visual-studio-code-remember-previous-commit-messages
