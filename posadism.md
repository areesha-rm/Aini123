  - "The Fourth International Posadist is a [[Trotskyist]] [[international]]. It was founded in [[1962]] by [[J. Posadas]], who had been the leader of the Latin America Bureau of the Fourth International in the 1950s, and of the Fourth International's section in Argentina. Between their split from the International Secretariat of the Fourth International in 1962 and Posadas' death in 1981, [[Posadists]] developed a strain of [[communism]] that included several fringe ideas, which brought them into conflict with more mainstream left-wing groups."
