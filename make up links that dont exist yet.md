# Make up Links That Dont Exist Yet

  - This is an [[optimist]] use of the internet.
    - I believe it has [[potential]].
    - [[pull]] [[optimistic]] [[thinking]] [[utopia]].
  - It is my [[objective]] that the [[agora]] supports any social conventions useful for this purpose. 
    - This works much better if it has [[sensible urls]].
- [[pull]] [[writing down links that don't exist yet]].
