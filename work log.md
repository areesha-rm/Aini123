# work log

- My [[journal]] serves as a bit of a work log, although sometimes I wonder if having a single page where I write *only* while actually doing focused work according to some particular definition (e.g. while doing [[pomodoros]]).
  - [[do]]
  - [[today]]
  - [[later]]

9m30 into a 25' first pomodoro of the day, I've done mostly maintenance of todos: ranked tasks to be done (needed to be done, not procrastinating), committed to my plan of four pomodoros today by scheduling pomodoros 1 to 4.
