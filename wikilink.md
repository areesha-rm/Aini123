# Wikilink

- A wikilink looks like this: [[wikilink]].
- Wikilinks come, wait for it, from wikis. They are great because they allow for very easy linking: you just [[link it as you go along]], then the link either works (because someone wrote that node/article/resource already) or you can click through and backfill it. 
  - I call this procedure link-driven writing.
