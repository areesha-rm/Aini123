# Wikilink

- A wikilink looks like this: [[wikilink]]. They are text surrounded by two square brackets.
  - Not to be confused with an [[ECMAScript internal property]], which is also surrounded by doubel brackets :) 
- Wikilinks come, wait for it, from [[wiki]]s :) But they need not be limited only to things we usually think of as wikis. 
  - You could use [[wikilinks everywhere]].
  - You can think of the Agora as a sort of distributed wiki, although users in this particular kind of wiki volunteer individual contributions instead of editing common pages (for now). 
- Wikilinks are the heart of this [[agora]].
  - [[wikilink]] resolves to ```node/wikilink``` in an [[agora]].
    - [[wikilink]] -> <https://anagora.org/node/wikilink> 
  - When needed [[slugify]] rules are applied.
    - [[wikilinks everywhere]] -> <https://anagora.org/node/wikilinks-everywhere>
  - Wikilinks are great because they allow for very easy linking: you just [[link it as you go along]], then the link either works (because someone wrote that node/article/resource already) or you can click through and backfill it. I call this procedure link-driven writing.
  - Whenever there is more than one [[node]] with a given wikilink in an Agora (typical use case: notes kept on a certain topic by different users), the Agora will surface all of them when resolving the wikilink in question. Example: [[README]].
- [[pull]] [[wikilinks]] [[wikilinks everywhere]]
