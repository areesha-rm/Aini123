- I read about [[polymers]] and [[acrylic]] a.k.a. [[PMMA]] via... the [[Cotton-Mouton Effect]] (?).
  - Also about [[Sky Pool, London]] which "was criticized as emblematic of economic inequalities in London.".
- [[Magnets]]
- [[Zine]] (enjoying it, working in [[overleaf]] with vim bindings is a pretty nice setup)
- Thought of [[Right Resolve]], [[Right Speech]], [[Right Action]], [[Right Freedom]]
- [[agora development]]:
  - [[agor.ai]] is partly fixed since yesterday (finally!) in the sense that link.agor.ai and flancia.agor.ai are back up in [[hypatia]] \o/
  - [ ] I still want to make https://agor.ai work and serve a 'default Agora' that lists the known Agoras in the domain ("network").
  - [x] I fixed my [[wiki vim]] setup to allow for easy markdown editing again and things like interacting with checkboxes.
  - [ ] I wanted to work on the [[plus operator]], a quite simple thing on the surface but it runs deep
  - [ ] I want to experiment with embedding images in nodes using [[Silverbullet]].
- [[flancia]] in [[pomodoros]]:
  - [[zine]]
