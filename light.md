# light

- a [[thing]].
  - a [[particle]] and a [[wave]]
  - [[process]]
    - perhaps [[emergent]]?
  - [[pull]] [[photons]]
  - [[pull]] [[fire]]
    - it has been said before: [[come on baby light my fire]].
  - [[beams of light]] seem correlated with [[free energy]]

Every day I try to ask myself: where are my [[lights]]?

It is a [[question]] with many interesting [[answers]].
