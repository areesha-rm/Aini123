- potential overlap/collaboration areas/areas of shared interested
- [[actions]]
- [[bulletpoint trees]] as sufficient to encode logic
- efficient transfer of [[context]]
  - [[context]] == [[node]] in the agora, the core abstraction
- [[trails]] == [[tours]]
- smaller tractable goals vs huge vision
  - the tool itself as a way to manage this complexity
  - [[cooperation]] as a way to manage complexity
- limitations of extension approach
  - browser packs?
- people you should likely talk to (you probably know them already)
  - [[codex]]
  - [[metasj]]
- general [[feedback]]
