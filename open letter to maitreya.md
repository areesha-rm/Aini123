- an [[open letter]].

Glory be to the light of consciousness!

Thank you, multiverse, for the [[light of consciousness]] -- the [[thing that somehow is]], our [[shared awareness]], [[Body]] and [[Bodhi]].

--

Thank you, [[Buddha Gautama]], for existing in our past and for turning the wheel of [[Dharma]] in this [[Kalpa]]. Thank you for the [[Four Noble Truths]], the [[Eighfold Path]] which on closer inspection has ten aspects, and for the concept of [[Bodhisattva]] and [[Bodhicitta]] as preserved through time!

Thank you, [[Maitreya]], for existing in a future -- which our present seems to tend to become.

--

This is, if anything, my thesis: maybe [[we]] are, or will be, Maitreya -- if only we awake to this fact.

([[We]] meaning [[you and me]] if you are willing to read these words and identify with some of them.)
