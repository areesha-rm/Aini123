- [[ingredients]]
  - 1.5 cup flour
  - 4 tsp baking powder
  - 0.5 tsp salt
  - 1.5 tsp cinnamon
  - (0.25 tsp each of ground nutmeg and cloves if you have)
  - ~1.1 cup sugar
  - ~0.9 cup oil
  - 3 eggs
  - 300g carrots
  - ~1 cup nuts, chopped, roasted a bit
- [[procedure]]
  - bake at 175C/350F for 35 mins or so
  - first you mix the dry and wet ingredients separately, then mix them together, you know the drill
  - then you fold in the carrots and nuts (I use almonds bc they're relatively cheap, recipes say pecans)
  - I'm pretty sure you could round the sugar and oil to 1 cup but haven't tried, that will be the last step to perfection next time I think
