Noded after the fact. It sometimes happens I don't get to write a journal on busy days at the day job, in particular when I get to really focus by necessity or chance. Yesterday (the topic of this node) was such a day: I needed to prepare and give a last minute presentation and was oncall for a second level rotation. By the time I closed the work laptop and opened my personal laptop I decided to go lay down in the sofa.

Then this happened :)
