# Foam Settings

- These are my [[foam]] ([[vscode]]) settings as of [[2021-01-13]]:
  - ```"foam.openDailyNote.directory": "journal"``` in settings.json to create daily notes in journal/:
    - <https://github.com/flancian/garden/blob/master/.vscode/settings.json>
  - A commit.txt in the repo for [[auto commit messages]], plus one-time setup with git config (see note).
  - The following in keybindings.json (which has to be set on a global basis):
> [
>     {
>         "key": "ctrl+shift+b",
>         "command": "vscodeMarkdownNotesBacklinks.focus"
>     },
>     {
>         "key": "ctrl+alt+[",
>         "command": "workbench.action.navigateBack"
>     },
>     {
>         "key": "ctrl+alt+]",
>         "command": "workbench.action.navigateForward"
>     },
>     {
>         "key": "ctrl+shift+a",
>         "command": "git.commitAll"
>     },
>     {
>         "key": "ctrl+alt+v",
>         "command": "toggleVim"
>     },
>     {
>         "key": "ctrl+shift+s",
>         "command": "workbench.action.files.saveFiles"
>     }
> ]
  - This results in being able to press ctrl-shift-a to auto-push changes to the [[agora]].
