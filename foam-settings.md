# Foam Settings

- These are my [[foam]] ([[vscode]]) settings as of [[2021-01-13]]:
- [[push]] [[settings.json]]:
```
"foam.openDailyNote.directory": "journal"
"vscodeMarkdownNotes.newNoteDirectory": "WORKSPACE_ROOT"
```
- [[push]] [[commit.txt]]:
```
Auto: misc.
```

- A commit.txt in the repo for [[auto commit messages]], plus one-time setup with git config (see note), if you don't want to have to write commit messages when updating the [[agora]].

  - The following in ```.config/Code/User/keybindings.json``` (this has to be set on a global basis due to [[vscode]] limitations):
```
[
     {
         "key": "ctrl+shift+b",
         "command": "vscodeMarkdownNotesBacklinks.focus"
     },
     {
         "key": "ctrl+alt+[",
         "command": "workbench.action.navigateBack"
     },
     {
         "key": "ctrl+alt+]",
         "command": "workbench.action.navigateForward"
     },
     {
         "key": "ctrl+shift+a",
         "command": "git.commitAll"
     },
     {
         "key": "ctrl+alt+v",
         "command": "toggleVim"
     },
     {
         "key": "ctrl+shift+s",
         "command": "workbench.action.files.saveFiles"
     }
]
```
  - This results in being able to press ctrl-shift-s to save all files; and ctrl-shift-a to push changes to the [[agora]] without the need to write a commit message.
