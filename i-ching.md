- [[go]] https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1331196342224494592
  - This is an example of a go link that it's useful to me but perhaps not as useful to others -- for others, going to wikipedia is probably a better bet?
- [[wiki]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching
- Similar to [[tarot]], I think, in that it seems to be an [[aid]] to [[creativity]].
- Referenced heavily in [[the man in the high castle]].
- Referenced by [[ricardo piglia]] in [[prisi√≥n perpetua]].
