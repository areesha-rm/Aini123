# Discord

- a [[tool]].
  - [[chat]]
  - I don't like using [[discord]] because it's not in the [[fediverse]], essentially.
    - [[tools]] in the knowledge and communication spaces that are not in the [[fediverse]] tend to give me the creeps in the long term.
    - But thankfully it can be [[bridged]] to the open/free internet relatively easily.
    - I prefer [[matrix]].
  - (Same goes mostly for tools which are not [[open source]], although I can more easily make exceptions to that. There is something deeply problematic about companies being closed with [[user data]].)
- [[pull]] [[discords]] [[discord servers]]
