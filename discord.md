# Discord

- [[tweet]]
  - I don't like using [[discord]] because it's not in the [[fediverse]].
  - [[tools]] in the knowledge and communication spaces that are not in the [[fediverse]] give me the creeps.
  - Same goes mostly for tools which are not [[open source]], although I can more easily make exceptions to that. There is something deeply problematic about companies being closed with [[user data]].
