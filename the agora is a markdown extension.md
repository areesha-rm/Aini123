- It is really important to me that the Agora is as compatible as possible with plain [[Markdown]] as possible.
  - [[Markdown]] is easy to use and most [[roam likes]] can be made to produce it (or use it as main format).
	  - I want the [[Agora]] to be [[maximally inclusive]] and [[minimally disruptive]].
	  - I'd like to support all reasonable formats eventually, starting with plain text (of course) and [[org mode]].
- The only extension to [[Markdown]] (you could say to [[natural language]]) that the [[Agora]] requires is [[wikilinks]].
	- Most Agora functionality requires only that users express an intent to interact with the agora by the use of conventions built on bare [[wikilinks]].
	- If you use a [[wikilink]] on [[social media]] and follow an [[agora]]'s account, you are expressing an intent to [[interop]].
	- [[pull]] [[wikilinks everywhere]]
