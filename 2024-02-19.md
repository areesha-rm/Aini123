- [[Silverbullet]] doesn't follow the convention of using journal/ for journals; and I wonder if that's not actually quite reasonable. Why wouldn't an ISO-formatted-date node be enough? That's what the [[Agora]] parses as journals ;)
- Honestly I'm maybe fine moving to journal-dir-less but I'd like to find a shortcut to 'go/create today's note'. I haven't found this in menus yet.
