- In some [[Flancias]] they [[saved Moloch]].
  - We [[rehabilitated]] them; meaning the [[egregore]] that managed to manifest and preserve themselves in [[humanity]] through [[history]].
  - We [[disentangled]] them from humanity.
  - #push [[moloch]]
    - What if we tried to [[save]] [[Moloch]]? To try to redeem them? Let them redefine themselves in a way that increases the common [[good]].
      - I'd give them the [[benefit of doubt]] if they used [[an agora]].
  - -> Would you like to [[slay moloch]] if we ever get the chance instead?
