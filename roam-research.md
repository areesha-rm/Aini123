# Roam Research

- [[go]] roamresearch.com
- Probably the lead in the [[personal knowledge management]] space.
- It is like a personall [[wiki]] with the following extra features:
  - [[backlinks]]: very important.
  - [[block references]]: important in that they are [[transclusion]].
- Unfortunately not [[open source]]. Has an [[extension ecosystem]] but that's also closed.
  - I find this worrying.
  - [[athens research]] tries to be an [[open source]] [[roam research]] -- and more.
  - See [[wikilinking tools]] for other alternatives.
- [[pull]] [[roam likes]]
