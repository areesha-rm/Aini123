# kindle

- a [[device]]
  - [[ebook]] [[reader]]
  - by [[amazon]]
  - I've got a [[love hate]] relationship with it. On the one hand it was my first and (so far) only [[ereader]], and it's good for the price (in particular the [[paperwhite]]). On the other I really, really dislike the [[drm]] bullshit [[amazon]] keeps peddling.
