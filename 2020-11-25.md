# 2020-11-25

- Discussed [[agora protocol]], [[agora push]] with [[arghzero]].
  - Mentioned [[zapier]], hadn't heard of that I believe.
- Remembered I have next Monday off ([[2020-11-30]]) and felt happy.
- Set up [[autofs]] so SD cards get automounted in Debian. Usually this is done by the desktop environment but in [[i3]] it needs manual setup (I don't mind).
- Read on [[equanimity]].
- Read on [[push down automata]]s.
