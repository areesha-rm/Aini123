# Agora 0.5.1

- Announcement: https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1327694477457289222.
- Added notion of 'subnode': a particular note by a particular user. subnodes agregate up to 'nodes': nodes are the set of all subnodes about a given entity (by default, subnodes with the same title).
- Added users page.
- Nodes page now lists the size of the node (number of subnodes).
- Added subnode-viewing mode, in which you can see just notes (files actually) by a particular user (and link to them).
  - Example: <https://anagora.org/subnode/garden/flancian/agora.md>
- Integrated one more garden, that of [[pen-coded]].
- Previously:
  - dev environment is now available (when up) at http://dev.anagora.org.
  - Moved dev/prod to separate '<https://flancia.org/go/agora>' and '<https://flancia.org/go/agora-server>' repos.
