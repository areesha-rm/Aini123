- #pull [[agora protocol]] [[tree structure]]
  - You tell an [[Agora]] about a [[tree structure]] and communicate an intent and the [[agora]] will try to reflect the tree in a medium.
  - You tell it a [[taxonomy]] and it associates the terms in [[agora]] terms (links them in the graph with a pull/push/annotated relationship).
  - #pull [[agora tree example]]
  - #push [[project snapshot]]
    - If you tell an [[Agora]] the shape of your nested [[tmux]], [[vnc]], [[ssh]], ... sessions it will try to periodically serialize/deserialize/execute as needed to replicate state across changes in computational context (including boots).
