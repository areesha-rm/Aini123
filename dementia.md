- Could be seen as an [[info hazard]] I believe, in the sense that learning more about the nature of dementia as it seems to "curse" some humans and animals can be deeply affecting.
  - Then again, this is true for many cases of [[suffering]].

First of all, rest assured: I believe [[technology]] will unlock great improvements for us who might be affected by dementia in the future. For an example of what I believe we can do to help those suffering from the condition, see [[Eugnosia]].
