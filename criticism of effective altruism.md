    - against [[longtermism]]
    - I think perhaps a too partial take on the movement overall?
      - [[hedging]] is core to it IMHO

    - nice take on [[art]] vs [[altruism]], which I think is a fake dichotomy.
    - I could characterize some of the positions here as 'extremist' -- at least [[ea extremist]] is quite mild :) and makes me think of a person who can change their mind, become less strictly utilitarian.
