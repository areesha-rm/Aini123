# meditations on procrastination

- Sometimes I definitely procrastinate because I don't have my top level todo list handy. To fix this I consolidated things on [[do]], but then it got too large, so now I'm doing half paper planning (day/week) and half [[stoa]] in [[do]]. I think both are fine -- I just have to make sure I have both on plain view while trying to do things.
