    - Improve the slogans. "In Flancia there is no poverty" sounds a bit "save the world", a platitude; but the idea of Flancia *is* to write a plan together to "save the world" and I intend to pursue it. That's the Flancian spirit. So I should make it clearer that it's an action-based rational, creative movement.
      - Perhaps: In Flancia they [[changed the world]]?
    - "In Flancia there is on privilege" and "In Flancia there is an Agora" got better reviews :)
    - I should read more on: [[postmodernism]] [[privilege]] [[ethics]]
      - [[Peter Singer]] is my delegate for [[ethics]]
      - Perhap [[read]] a criticism of [[Peter Singer]]
