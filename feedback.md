  - I believe in the huge potential of the [[fediverse]] and the [[knowledge metaverse]].
- This is feedback I've gotten.

    - Improve the slogans. "In Flancia there is no poverty" sounds a bit "save the world", generic, a platitude; but the idea behind Flancia *is* to write a plan together to at least try to "[[change the world]]"; it could communicate that. I should in general make it clearer that it's an action-based rational, creative movement.
      - Perhaps: In Flancia they [[changed the world]]?
    - "In Flancia there is no privilege" and "In Flancia there is an Agora" got better reviews.
    - I should read more on: [[postmodernism]] [[privilege]] [[ethics]] [[feminism]]
      - [[Peter Singer]] is my delegate for [[ethics]]
      - Perhaps [[read]] a criticism of [[Peter Singer]]
      - If you have a delegate in a certain area (think of [[liquid democracy]]), it seems to me one is ethically bound to stay up to date with criticism of the delegate.
