    - Improve the slogans. "In Flancia there is no poverty" sounds a bit "save the world", generic, a platitude; but the idea behind Flancia *is* to write a plan together to at least try to "[[change the world]]"; it could communicate that. I should in general make it clearer that it's an action-based rational, creative movement.
      - Perhaps: In Flancia they [[changed the world]]?
    - "In Flancia there is no privilege" and "In Flancia there is an Agora" got better reviews.
    - I should read more on: [[postmodernism]] [[privilege]] [[ethics]] [[feminism]]
      - Let it be known that [[Peter Singer]] is my delegate for [[ethics]], together with the [[Buddha]].
      - I try to read criticisms of both to hedge :)
      - (If you have a [[delegate]] in a certain area (think of [[liquid democracy]]), it seems to me one is ethically bound to stay up to date with criticism of the delegate.)
