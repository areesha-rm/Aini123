# Agora Fuzzy Matching

- The Agora will make use of [[fuzzy matching]] to maximize the chances to surface relevant content.
- All of the following should be surfaced in unison whenever one of them is surfaced, likely:
  - [[wikilink]]
  - [[wikilinks]]
  - [[wikilinked]]
- There should be some support for [[acronym]]s as well:
  - [[united states]]
  - [[US]]
  - [[U S]]
- And perhaps, going further, [[united states of america]] should be consolidated with the preceding as well.
- [[ranking]] Perhaps fuzzy matched content is ranked lower than perfectly matched?
