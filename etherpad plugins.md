# etherpad plugins

- a [[list]]
  - [[go]] https://stoa.anagora.org/admin/plugins (sorry, only I can access this for now :) )
  - but it's just /admin/plugins in any [[etherpad]] instance
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/ep_git_commit_saved_revision looks interesting
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/ep_openid_connect could be used to allow for single-user pads
- https://github.com/ether/ep_webrtc
