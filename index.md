This is the [[index]] of my [[digital garden]], which serves also as an entry point of sorts to the wider [[Agora of Flancia]].

If you are reading this in the [[Agora]] proper, you should see it rendered in context and with a [[navigation UI]]. If you are reading this garden directly in its source (e.g. [[git repository]]), consider visiting <strong>anagora.org</strong> or some other Agora this garden is known to be in to render it with resolved [[wikilinks]] and amenities ;)

  
# Nodes
In an Agora, a [[node]] is a collection of [[resources]] having to do with a topic; a [[thing]] or an [[idea]] or whatever you want the node to mean.

The resources are files found in gardens like this one. This note, for example, belongs to node [[index]] because its name is [[index.md]].

The following might be interesting nodes to serve as entry points to this garden.

  - [[Person]]: contains links to nodes about [[people]].
  - [[Agora]]: I write about the Agora often, in the Agora of course :) This node, like all and the Agora proper, is a [[work in progress]] -- but it should be a reasonable starting point to understand what the [[Agora]] is and what it tries to achieve.
  - [[Commons]]: the [[Free]] [[Commons]] is an ideal that the Agora tries to uphold and represent for the benefit of its users and all sentient beings. A lot of my writing has to do with the Commons in one way or another.
  - #go: this is an Agora action you can find in the context links to nodes which contain a URL marked as canonical for the topic in question. It is an example of an [[Agora action]] which [[redirects]] to these URLs on demand.
    
Beyond checking the resources in the nodes proper (mostly text notes), remember to check for [[links]] in and out of each context established through use.

# Journals
- Nodes whose titles look like dates, like e.g. those matching [[ISO 8601]] or [[RFC 3339]], are interpreted as declarations of public [[journals]].
- If you visit node [[journals]] in an Agora, it should lead you to a variety of time-anchored contributions, e.g.:
    - [[2024-02-19]].
    - [[journal/2024-02-23]].
    - [[2024-02-24]].
    - [[2024-05-28]].

# How to contribute to this Agora

## If you like to take personal notes (recommended)
See [[Agora editors]] for alternatives. I ([[Flancian]]) currently recommend:

- [[Silver Bullet]] ([[MIT]] license) <- start here by default as of the time of writing ([[2024]]).
- [[Logseq]] ([[AGPL]]).
- [[Obsidian]] (closed source).

Then sign up for a [[git]] provider, like https://codeberg.org (or the better known and decent but corporate-run https://github.com), upload your garden to it (this yields the nice side effect of keeping it backed up but under your control!) and send us its location and your desired username. See [[Agora signup]] for more.

## If you prefer to contribute from social media
You can also contribute straight from the [[Fediverse]] once you get an account in a server (e.g. one providing [[Mastodon]] to a community, or one you run yourself). I am part of and help run [[social.coop]]; it is a good one if you are interested in [[cooperativism]]. There's thousands more! See [[Map of the Fediverse]] for more.

Once you sign up to the [[Fediverse]], you can follow [[@agora@botsin.space]] and it will watch your posts for [[wikilinks]]. You can configure the bot to include the full text of your post or only links; and to also include, and respond to, post with #hashtags.

## If you just want to write down something quickly and don't care about attribution
Consider just leaving an anonymous note anywhere around the [[Agora]] in a [[stoa]], which is a public space meant for collaboration (think [[wiki]] or shared editor) available in each [[node]].

## For more
Please [[reach out]] if you want to try [[note taking]] or are interested in the [[Fediverse]] and need help, regardless of whether you would like to contribute your notes to the [[Agora]].

Please see [[how to edit this Agora]] if you're interested in contributing or [[how to run an Agora]] for instructions for running your own.
