- An [[index]].
  - To this [[digital garden]].
  - If you are reading this in [[an Agora]], you should see it in the context of several other indexes -- potentially one for each user contributing to that particular Agora :)
    - You can add your own by keeping an `index.md` file in your garden and contributing it to the Agora.
    - If the Agora index gets too noisy (as the Agora grows) we might want to implement [[ranking]] and [[filtering]] algorithms. These will of course be ***open source*** and ***community driven***.
  - The following are maybe interesting entry points to this garden, and to the Agora at large. Beyond the notes in the nodes themselves, check for backlinks.
    - [[person]]
      - contains links to nodes about [[people]]
    - [[go]]
      - contains links to URLs tagged as canonical for some node
