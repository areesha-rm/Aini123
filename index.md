- An [[index]].
  - To this [[digital garden]].
  - If you are reading this in [[an Agora]], you should see it in the context of several other indexes -- potentially one for each user contributing to that particular Agora :)
  - You can add your own by keeping an `index.md` file in your [[digital garden]] and contributing it to this Agora.
    - If the Agora index gets too noisy (as the Agora grows) we might want to implement [[ranking]] and [[filtering]] algorithms. These will be ***open source*** and ***community driven***.
- I am a [[Flancian]], who are you?
