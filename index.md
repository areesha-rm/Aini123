- Here we are in the [[index]] of the [[Agora]], meaning an [[entrypoint]] for my [[public]] [[digital garden]], and by extension to its composition with the [[Agora of Flancia]] and others I belong to.
  - If you are reading this in an [[Agora]] proper, you should see it in the context of several other indexes -- potentially one for each user contributing to that particular Agora :)
  - You can add your own contribution to the index of any Agoras you participate in by storing an `index.md` file in your [[garden]] or [[stoa]] and contributing it to the Agora in question; please see [[how to edit this Agora]] below if interested.
  
# Nodes
A [[node]] is a collection of [[resources]] having to do with a topic; a [[thing]] or an [[idea]] or whatever you want it to be.

The following are maybe interesting nodes to serve as entry points to this garden, and to the Agora at large. 

  - [[Person]]: contains links to nodes about [[people]].
  - [[Agora]]: I write about the Agora often, in the Agora of course :) This node, like all and the Agora proper, is a [[work in progress]] -- but it should be a reasonable starting point to understand what the [[Agora]] is and what it tries to achieve.
  - [[Commons]]: the [[Free]] [[Commons]] is an ideal that the Agora tries to uphold and represent for the benefit of its users and all sentient beings. A lot of my writing has to do with the Commons in one way or another.
  - #go: you can find in the context links to nodes which contain a URL marked as canonical for the topic in question. It is an example of an [[Agora action]] which [[redirects]] to these URLs on demand.
    
Beyond checking the resources in the nodes proper (mostly text notes), remember to check for [[links]] in and out of each context established through use.

If you are reading this in [[git]] or a partially supported [[editor]], please refer to https://anagora.org or some other well-known Agora to see what you're reading with fully resolved links and offered context :).

# Journals
- Nodes whose titles look like dates, like e.g. those matching [[ISO 8601]] or [[RFC 3339]], are interpreted as declarations of public [[journals]].
- If you visit node [[journals]] in an Agora, it should lead you to a variety of time-anchored contributions, e.g.:
    - [[2024-02-19]].
    - [[journal/2024-02-23]].
    - [[2024-02-24]].

## How to edit this Agora
See [[Agora editors]] for alternatives. I ([[Flancian]]) currently recommend:

- [[Silver Bullet]] ([[MIT]] license) <- start here by default as of the time of writing ([[2024]]).
- [[Logseq]] ([[AGPL]]).
- [[Obsidian]] (closed source).

Then sign up for a [[git]] provider, like https://codeberg.org or the better known and decent but corporate-run https://github.com, 

You can also contribute straight from the [[Fediverse]] once you get an account in a server (e.g. one providing [[Mastodon]] to a community, or one you run yourself). I am part of and help run [[social.coop]]; it is a good one if you are interested in [[cooperativism]]. There's thousands more! See [[Map of the Fediverse]] for more.

Once you sign up to the [[Fediverse]], you can follow [[@agora@botsin.space]] and it will watch your posts for [[wikilinks]]. You can configure the bot to include the full text of your post or only links; and to also include, and respond to, post with #hashtags.

Please [[reach out]] if you want to try [[note taking]] or contributing to the [[Agora]] in general and need help!
