- Here we are in the [[index]] of the [[Agora]], meaning an [[entrypoint]] for my [[public]] [[digital garden]], and by extension to its composition with the [[Agora of Flancia]] and others I belong to.
  - If you are reading this in an [[Agora]], you should see it in the context of several other indexes -- potentially one for each user contributing to that particular Agora :)
  - You can add your own index to any Agoras you participate in by storing an `index.md` file in your [[garden]] or [[stoa]] and contributing it to the Agora in question.
  
# Nodes
The following are maybe interesting entry points to this garden, and to the Agora at large. Beyond the notes in the nodes themselves, check for links.

  - [[person]]
    - contains links to nodes about [[people]]
  - #go
    - contains, and [[redirects]] to, URLs tagged as canonical for some node.

# Journals
- Nodes matching [[ISO 8601]], [[RFC 3339]] and derivations are interpreted as declarations of [[journals]].
- Thereafter [[journals]]:
  - ...will lead you to a variety of nodes matching a date, like:
    - [[2024-02-19]].
    - [[journal/2024-02-23]].
    - [[2024-02-24]].

## How to edit this Agora
See [[Agora editors]] for alternatives. As a [[Flancian]] I currently recommend:

- [[Silver Bullet]] (([[MIT]] license)<- start here by default as of the time of writing ([[2024]]).
- [[Logseq]] ([[AGPL]]).
- [[Obsidian]] (closed source).

You can also contribute straight from the [[Fediverse]] once you get an account in a server (e.g. one providing [[Mastodon]] to a community, or one you run yourself). I am part of and help run [[social.coop]]; it is a good one if you are interested in [[cooperativism]]. There's thousands more! See [[Map of the Fediverse]] for more.

Once you sign up to the [[Fediverse]], you can follow [[@agora@botsin.space]] and it will watch your posts for [[wikilinks]]. You can configure the bot to include the full text of your post or only links; and to also include, and respond to, post with #hashtags.

Please [[reach out]] if you want to try [[note taking]] or contributing to the [[Agora]] in general and need help!
