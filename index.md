- The [[index]].
  - Meaning an [[entypoint]] for my [[public]] [[digital garden]], and by extension to its composition with the [[Agora of Flancia]].
  - If you are reading this in an [[Agora]], you should see it in the context of several other indexes -- potentially one for each user contributing to that particular Agora :)
  - You can add your own index to any Agoras you participate in by storing an `index.md` file in your [[garden]] or [[stoa]] and contributing it to the Agora in question.
  
## Nodes
The following are maybe interesting entry points to this garden, and to the Agora at large. Beyond the notes in the nodes themselves, check for links.

  - [[person]]
    - contains links to nodes about [[people]]
  - #go
    - contains, and [[redirects]] to, URLs tagged as canonical for some node.

# Journals
- Nodes matching [[ISO 8601]], [[RFC 3339]] and derivations are interpreted as declarations of [[journals]].
- Thereafter [[journals]]:
  - ...will lead you to a variety of nodes matching a date, like:
    - [[2024-02-19]].
    - [[journal/2024-02-23]].
    - [[2024-02-24]].

## How to edit this Agora
See [[Agora editors]] for alternatives. As a [[Flancian]] I currently recommend:

- [[Silver Bullet]] (([[MIT]] license)<- start here by default as of the time of writing ([[2024]]).
- [[Logseq]] ([[AGPL]]).
- [[Obsidian]] (closed source).

Please [[reach out]] if you want to try [[note taking]], in the Agora or in your private garden, and need help!
