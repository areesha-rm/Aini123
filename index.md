- An [[index]].
  - To this, meaning my [[digital garden]], and by extension its composition with the [[Agora of Flancia]].
    - If you are reading this in an [[Agora]], you should see it in the context of several other indexes -- potentially one for each user contributing to that particular Agora :)
  - You can add your own index to the Agoras you participate in by storing an `index.md` file in your [[garden]] or [[stoa]] and contributing it to the Agora.
  - The following are maybe interesting entry points to this garden, and to the Agora at large. Beyond the notes in the nodes themselves, check for links.
    - [[person]]
      - contains links to nodes about [[people]]
    - [[go]]
      - contains links to URLs tagged as canonical for some node
- **Here again** on [[2024-02-19]] as I'm trying out [[silverbullet]] = [[silver bullet]] as [[Agora Editor]]. It is looking highly promising -- if you want to try out [[note taking]], in the Agora or in your private garden, consider giving it a shot!
- [[journals]]
  - will lead you to a variety of nodes matching a date, like:
    - [[journal/2024-02-23]]
    - [[2024-02-24]] is also acceptable
