- Installed surround in vscode but it didn't do what I expected.
  - vim mode gets in the way with native surround support -- but it might also provide a solution: https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim#vim-surround
  - ysiw] surrounds a word with [], then I need to do . to surround it with another one.
  - For visual selections it's S], but no obvious way to surround with two :(
- Discussed [[agora plan]] with [[arghzero]].
  - Might want to move FR/improvements tracking to the github tracker.
- [[offline twitter]]
  - Game: [[i ching]] lite with an appropriate book.
  - e.g. random.randint(1, 1169) and A Pattern Language.
