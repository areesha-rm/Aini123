# Agora

- To participate in the Agora, you need a way to publish files online; and to let the Agora maintainer know, so they can pull them.
- An Agora is, in its most basic form, a set of conventions. Users that follow the convention associated with an Agora are said to be *in* the Agora.
  - Useful conventions are made explicit in an Agora's [[CONTRACT]].
- An Agora is built around a [[distributed knowledge graph]] maintained by its users. By [[you]].
  - If you want to participate, please check out [[agora editor]].
  - [[pull]] [[maximally inclusive]]
- The Agora as an organism tries to be a good pro-social [[internet citizen]].
- If you'd like to participate, please refer to [[agora help]] or reach out to [[me]].
- Check out [[agora plan]] if you are interested in the nerdy stuff.
- [[agora protocol]], [[wikilinks everywhere]], [[agora twitter integration]], [[flancia]].
