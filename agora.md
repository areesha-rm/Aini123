# Agora

- [The Agora is a distributed knowledge graph and experimental social network](https://anagora.org/).
  - As an Agora *guest* you can currently:
    - Navigate the Agora, which is composed of nodes which aggregate content from many users on the same topic or entity.
    - Make use of [[backlinks]] and [[pulled nodes]] to discover relevant content.
  - As an Agora *user* you can:
    - Have your content be surfaced to users at relevant times (when they are visiting a node on a relevant topic or entity).
    - Have relevant content be surfaced to *you* as you work on your [[personal knowledge graph]].
    - Make use of [[agora actions]].
  - Anyone can run an Agora of their own if they so desire. The Agora is [[open source]].
  - If you want to learn more about the [[experimental]] nature of this Agora, please refer to [this Hacker News comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25577016).
  - If you want to keep up to date with development, consider adding me on Twitter or Mastodon: [[flancian]].
- To sign up for the Agora, first you need to publish your [[digital garden]] or [[content]] elsewhere online. The Agora doesn't host your data, but rather pulls it from a location *you* control and renders it for you and other users; it interlinks it with that of other users.
  - If you know your way around [[git]], [[markdown]] on git is the default format. If you use [[roam]] or a [[roam like]] or you have a notes database, you're almost there. Please refer to [agora howto](https://anagora.org/go/agora-howto) for detailed instructions.
  - Whatever participation mechanism you choose, you need to let an Agora [[maintainer]] know where your content is, so it can be pulled and [[integrated]]. We strive to continuously support new sources and formats. Please send email to signup@anagora.org with:
    - The URL for your content.
    - Your desired username.
  - The Agora wants to be [[maximally inclusive]], but it is in its infancy; it is a [[work in progress]]. If you want to participate and can't, please also send email to signup@anagora.org to let us know.
  - Through projects such as [[agora twitter integration]], we hope to make the Agora available to anyone that has access to a social network account.
- An Agora is, in its most basic form, a set of useful conventions.
  - Useful conventions are made explicit through an Agora's [[CONTRACT]] and the writing of its users.
  - The Agora is built around the notion of the [[wikilink]]: see [[wikilinks fanout]] and [[wikilinks everywhere]]. 
  - You can think of the Agora as a distributed [[wiki]] or an experiment in [[semantic web]] [[applications]] if you are so inclined.
  - An Agora is a [[distributed knowledge graph]] maintained by the users of an experimental [[social network]].
    - By [[you]] and [[me]]. Anyone can participate if they are willing.
    - Check out [[agora howto]] (users) or [[agora plan]] (developers) if you want to jump in.
- This Agora tries to be a good [[internet citizen]]. The [[agora protocol]] is openly developed and can be implemented by anyone.
    - [[wikilinks everywhere]] is currently its most focused application.
