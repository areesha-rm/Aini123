# Agora

- To participate in the Agora, right now you need some way to publish files online. The Agora doesn't host your data, but rather pulls it from a location *you* control and renders it for you and other users. 
  - If you know your way around [[git]], [[markdown]] on git is the default format. 
  - In any case then you need to let an Agora [[maintainer]] know where your content is, so it can be pulled and [[integrated]].
  - If you want to participate and need further instructions please check out [[agora editor]] or contact the [[maintainer]].
  - The Agora wants to be [[maximally inclusive]], but it's in its infancy; a work in progress. If you want to participate and can't, please reach out to the [[maintainer]].
- Through projects such as [[agora twitter integration]], we hope to make the Agora available to anyone that has access to a social network account.
- An Agora is, in its most basic form, a set of useful conventions.
  - Useful conventions are made explicit in an Agora's [[CONTRACT]] and in the writing of its users.
- An Agora is built around a [[distributed knowledge graph]] maintained by its users. By [[you]].
  - Check out [[agora plan]] if you are interested in more nerdy stuff.
- This Agora tries to be a good pro-social [[internet citizen]].
- [[see also]] [[agora protocol]], [[wikilinks everywhere]], [[agora twitter integration]], [[flancia]].
