# Agora

- **The Agora is a distributed knowledge graph and experimental social network.**
	- See [[go/agora-slides]] if you'd like an introduction to the key concepts.
- The [[aim]] of this [[agora]] is to pro-socially maintain a [[distributed knowledge graph]] tailored specifically to the general goal of solving problems: those of its [[users]] and [[society]] at large..
- As an Agora *guest user* or [[reader]] you can currently:
    - Navigate the Agora, which is composed of [[nodes]] which aggregate content from many users about the same topic or entity.
    - Make use of [[agora features]] to surface relevant content.
- As an Agora *full user* or [[writer]] you can:
    - Have your content be surfaced to readers at relevant times (when they are visiting a [[node]] for which your content is considered relevant by the community).
    - Have relevant crowdsourced content be surfaced to you as you traverse your [[notes repository]].
    - Make use of [[agora actions]] to control the agora straight from your ntoes.
		- Visit [[agora editor]] to join!
- Anyone can run an Agora of their own if they so desire. This Agora is [[open source]]: [[go/agora]].
	- To [[sign up]] for the Agora, which means volunteering your writing and media to it, please consult [[agora editor]].
	  
  - The Agora wants to be [[maximally inclusive]], but it is in its infancy; it is a [[work in progress]]. If you want to participate and can't, please also send email to signup@anagora.org to let us know. Through projects such as [[agora twitter integration]], we hope to make the Agora available to anyone that has access to a social network account. If you want to learn more about the [[experimental]] nature of this Agora, please refer to [this Hacker News comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25577016).
