# Agora

- To participate in the Agora, right now you need some way to publish files online. The Agora doesn't host your data, but rather pulls it from a location *you* control and renders it for you and other users. 
  - If you know your way around [[git]], [[markdown]] on git is the default format. 
  - If you don't: you need to let an Agora [[maintainer]] know where your content is, so it can be pulled and [[integrated]]. We strive to continuously support new sources and formats. Please send email to signup@anagora.org.
  - The Agora wants to be [[maximally inclusive]], but it's in its infancy; a [[work in progress]]. If you want to participate and can't, please also send email to signup@anagora.org.
  - Through projects such as [[agora twitter integration]], we hope to make the Agora available to anyone that has access to a social network account.
- An Agora is, in its most basic form, a set of useful conventions.
  - Useful conventions are made explicit through an Agora's [[CONTRACT]] and the writing of its users.
  - The Agora is built around the notion of the [[wikilink]]: see [[wikilinks fanout]] and [[wikilinks everywhere]]. You can think of the Agora as a distributed [[wiki]] or an experiment in [[semantic web]] [[applications]] if you are so inclined.
  - An Agoraa is a [[distributed knowledge graph]] maintained by the users of an experimental [[social network]].
    - By [[you]] and [[me]].
    - Check out [[agora plan]] if you are interested in more nerdy stuff.
- This Agora tries to be a good pro-social [[internet citizen]].
  - [[see also]] [[agora protocol]], [[wikilinks everywhere]], [[agora twitter integration]], [[flancia]].
