# Agora
- An Agora is, in its most basic form, a set of conventions. Users that follow the convention associated with an Agora are said to be *in* the Agora.
- Useful conventions are made explicit in an Agora's [[CONTRACT]].
- An Agora is built around a distributed knowledge graph maintained by its users.
- If this is your first time using an Agora, please refer to [[Agora Help]].  
- In [[Flancia]], of course, there is an Agora: https://flancia.org/agora.
- See also: [[Agora Plan]], [[Agora Protocol]].
