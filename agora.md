# Agora

- **The Agora is a distributed knowledge graph and experimental social network.**
  - The [[aim]] of this [[agora]] is to pro-socially maintain a [[distributed knowledge graph]] tailored specifically to the general goal of solving problems: those of its [[users]] and [[society]] at large..
  - As an Agora *guest user* or [[reader]] you can currently:
    - Navigate the Agora, which is composed of [[nodes]] which aggregate content from many users about the same topic or entity.
    - Make use of [[backlinks]] and [[pulled nodes]] to discover relevant content.
  - As an Agora *full user* or [[writer]] you can:
    - Have your content be surfaced to readers at relevant times (when they are visiting a [[node]] for which your content is considered relevant by the community).
    - Have relevant content be surfaced to you as you traverse your [[personal knowledge graph]].
    - Make use of [[agora actions]].
	- See [[agora editor]] to join!
- Anyone can run an Agora of their own if they so desire. This Agora is [[open source]]: [[go/agora]].
	- The [[agora]] is in the [[federation]]! Add it now: @agora@botsin.space, <https://twitter.com/an_agora>.
	- This [[agora]] includes [[agora search]].
	- To run an Agora, please refer to <https://anagora.org/go/agora>.
- To [[sign up]] for the Agora, which means volunteering your writing and media to it, please consult [[agora editor]].
  - In a nutshell: you need to put your content, which can be plain text or [[markdown]] if you're into that sort of thing, somewhere online. https://github.com and https://gitlab.com both work fine for this. This amounts to publishing a [[blog]] or [[digital garden]] online. The Agora doesn't host your data, but rather pulls it from a location *you* control and renders it for you and other users; it interlinks your data with that of other users as you wish.
  - The Agora wants to be [[maximally inclusive]], but it is in its infancy; it is a [[work in progress]]. If you want to participate and can't, please also send email to signup@anagora.org to let us know. Through projects such as [[agora twitter integration]], we hope to make the Agora available to anyone that has access to a social network account. If you want to learn more about the [[experimental]] nature of this Agora, please refer to [this Hacker News comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25577016). If you want to keep up to date with development, consider adding me on Twitter or Mastodon: [[flancian]].
