# Agora

- **The Agora is a distributed knowledge graph and experimental social network.**
  - As an Agora *guest* you can currently:
    - Navigate the Agora, which is composed of [[nodes]] which aggregate content from many users about the same topic or entity.
    - Make use of [[backlinks]] and [[pulled nodes]] to discover relevant content.
  - As an Agora *user* you can:
    - Have your content be surfaced to readers at relevant times (when they are visiting a [[node]] for which your content is considered relevant by the community).
    - Have relevant content be surfaced to you as you traverse your [[personal knowledge graph]].
    - Make use of [[agora actions]].
  - Anyone can run an Agora of their own if they so desire. This Agora is [[open source]].
- The [[agora]] has a [[search engine]].
  - It tries to search all [[agoras]], and also the internet as it manifests an [[intent to cooperate]].
    - See [[stoa]].
  - You can use [[open search]] to add it to your browser while you're visiting it.
  - You can have it as default search engine, like I sometimes do, or you can associate it with a prefix. I use 'a' and 'an'. Like in 'an entity'. 
- *The [[agora]] is in the [[federation]]! Add it now: @agora@botsin.space.*
- To run an Agora, please refer to <https://anagora.org/go/agora>.
- To [[sign up]] for the Agora, which means volunteering writing and media to it:
  - First, you need to put your content, which can be plain text or [[markdown]] if you're into that sort of thing, somewhere online. https://github.com and https://gitlab.com both work fine for this.
    - This amounts to publishing a [[blog]] or [[digital garden]] or [[content]] elsewhere online. The Agora doesn't host your data, but rather pulls it from a location *you* control and renders it for you and other users; it interlinks your data with that of other users as you wish.
    - If you know your way around [[git]], [[markdown]] on git is the default format. If you use [[roam]] or a [[roam like]] or you have a notes database, you're almost there. Please refer to [agora howto](https://anagora.org/go/agora-howto) for detailed instructions.
  - Second, you need to signal an [[intent to cooperate]] with the [[agora]]. This means telling the world that your content can be pulled by the Agora and [[integrated]] into a social graph. To do this, you can send a PR for [[gardens yaml]] or send email to signup@anagora.org. Alternatively you can also [tweet at this agora's maintainer](https://twitter.com/flancian). In any case, please include:
    - An URL for your content.
    - Your desired username.
    - Confirmation that you are currently in agreement with <https://anagora.org/contract>. If you are ever considered in disagreement by you or others, please feel free to use the [[agora]] as a mechanism to resolve disputes.

The Agora wants to be [[maximally inclusive]], but it is in its infancy; it is a [[work in progress]]. If you want to participate and can't, please also send email to signup@anagora.org to let us know. Through projects such as [[agora twitter integration]], we hope to make the Agora available to anyone that has access to a social network account.
If you want to learn more about the [[experimental]] nature of this Agora, please refer to [this Hacker News comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25577016).
