    - with the titular [[poem]] in it and 31 others
    - might 32 (2^5) have significance?
  - [[meta]] the following section assumes [[auto push]], which I haven't implemented yet :)
    - once it's implemented, each node in the following list should get the children blocks automatically transcluded
  - [[the beautiful poem]]
    - [[phallocentric]]
    - didn't find it beautiful, but hey, at least it's honest
    - sexual in nature
  - [[december 24]]
    - didn't get it, but I like how these are short
  - [[milk for the duck]]
    - sexual in nature
    - seems to be about lack of self confidence after not having sex for 20 days
  - [[november 3]]
    - echoes of [[frank o'hara]]?
    - "there's a pretty girl I want to look at" -- [[richard brautigan]] was all about the ladies
  - [[flowers for those you love]]
    - about [[venereal diseases]]
    - a bit like a [[psa]]

    - [[found object]]
  - [[star hole]]
    - I like this one
    - "I sit here / on the perfect end / of a star / watching light / pour itself toward me"
  - [[love poem]]
    - seems there's an ironic vein, as this poem is about not-loving
  - [[I lie here in a strange girl's apartment]]
    - [[ladies man]] strikes again
    - dedicated to [[marcia pacaud]]

  - [[december 30]]
    - about a [[fart]]
  - [[lovers]]
    - "put her in a low brass bed"
    - women aren't very active in many of these, perhaps I'm biased by the phallocentric opener but Brautigan feels a bit objectifying?
  - [[a mid-february sky dance]]
    - I liked this one, this feels more participative (a proper dance)

    - a [[banger]]
      - taken straight (without irony), it embodies technological optimism and makes me think of the [[agora]]
    - [[cybernetic meadow]]
      - [[programming harmony]]
    - [[cybernetic forest]]
      - "where deer stroll peacefully / past computers / as if they were flowers / with spinning blossoms"
    - [[cybernetic ecology]]
      - [[free of our labors]]
    - [[robert gangeware]] "American poets seldom portray the happy marriage of technology and the natural world. Thus the optimism of the following poem is somewhat uniqueâ€”unless the reader detects [[irony]], in which case the poem joins [[the mainstream of antitechnological American verse]]."
    - [[charles perry]] "The [[robots will do all the work]] vision of [[utopia]] was certainly widesread, the subject for instance of Richard Brautigan's famous poem, 'All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace' and one of the recurring ideas in the [[Leary-Snyder]] debate in [[Oracle No. 7]]."
      - this seems like a reference to [[san francisco oracle]]
