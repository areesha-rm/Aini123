    - with the titular [[poem]] in it and 31 others
    - might 32 (2^5) have significance?
  - [[meta]] the following section assumes [[auto push]], which I haven't implemented yet :)
    - once it's implemented, each node in the following list should get the children blocks automatically transcluded
  - [[the beautiful poem]]
    - [[phallocentric]]
    - didn't find it beautiful, but hey, at least it's honest
    - sexual in nature
  - [[december 24]]
    - didn't get it, but I like how these are short
  - [[milk for the duck]]
    - sexual in nature
    - seems to be about lack of self confidence after not having sex for 20 days
  - [[november 3]]
    - echoes of [[frank o'hara]]?
    - "there's a pretty girl I want to look at" -- [[richard brautigan]] was all about the ladies
  - [[flowers for those you love]]
    - about [[venereal diseases]]
    - a bit like a [[psa]]
  - [[san francisco]]
    - [[found object]]
  - [[star hole]]
    - I like this one
    - "I sit here / on the perfect end / of a star / watching light / pour itself toward me"
  - [[love poem]]
    - seems there's an ironic vein, as this poem is about not-loving
  - [[I lie here in a strange girl's apartment]]
    - [[ladies man]] strikes again
    - dedicated to [[marcia pacaud]] 
  - [[it's raining in love]]
    - I like this one
    - "or perhaps i start to examine, evaluate, compute what I am saying"
    - "in other words / I get a little creepy"
    - "it's raining somwhere, programming flowers / and keeping snails happy"
  - [[hey! this is what it's all about]]

  - [[december 30]]
    - about a [[fart]]
  - [[lovers]]
    - "put her in a low brass bed"
    - women aren't very active in many of these, perhaps I'm biased by the phallocentric opener but Brautigan feels a bit objectifying?
  - [[a mid-february sky dance]]
    - I liked this one, this feels more participative (a proper dance)
    - "dance toward me, please, as if you were a star / with light-years piled on top of your hair, smiling"
