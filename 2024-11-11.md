- I found a 'task list' (I have 7-8 at any given time, usually anything from a3 to a4, envelopes and forms and such that I reuse to write things to do later) which I sort of completed so I archived it. It had the number [[131]] on it, without further context, although it was close to a task related to Wikipedia in the Agora that I have advanced.
  - It is prime in case you're wondering :) [[prime/131]].
  - Which reminds me about the notion of having prime/<n> be autopulled when n is a number. Hmm.
- [[Algún día]]
