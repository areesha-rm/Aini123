- I intend to leave half of my things to my partner and most of the other half to [[Flancia]] as it is defined in my writing and the best known source of truth, as of today https://anagora.org.
	- [[friends]], [[flancians]] and other [[agorafolk]] can disambiguate through peer governance as needed :)
	- My default would be that all that goes to [[Flancia]] is redirected to [[effective altruism]], in particular to advance [[basic income]] programs like those trialed by [[give directly]] and [[Flancia collective]]; and to foster the ideals of the [[flancian revolution]] where appropriate.
  - Update (2023): I separated from [[L.]]. Half the long term investments and cash should go to her if I die before we divorce.
  - Update (2023): I now intend to maintain two more fleshed out/explicit versions of my testamente, one public/one private:
    - #public at [[last will]].
    - #private at [[testamento]], in Spanish. This is meant to be read primarily/first/mostly by people it has been explicitly shared with.
