- At [[work]], meaning in the office, after a few days out/WFH due to disease. It's nice to see my coworkers/have in person conversations.
  - I had a productive day at home yesterday which hopefully will translate to a productive week in-office. Let's see :) 
- No meetings after work tonight! Which is nice.
