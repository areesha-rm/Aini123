      - check https://git.coop/social.coop/community/operations/-/issues for open issues, although the [[spam trap]]; can ignore meet.coop registrations
        - example: https://git.coop/social.coop/community/operations/-/issues/633
        - check open collective user exists; check it's not obviously spam
        - use labels to track workflow (spam, in progress, approved)
        - we wait for the next two oncalls, then we close as non responsive
        - check admin@social.coop for activity (have it logged in in a separate window)
