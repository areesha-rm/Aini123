    - [[registrations]] overall
      - shared [[zoho]] inbox for registrations
      - check https://git.coop/social.coop/community/operations/-/issues for open issues, although the [[spam trap]]; can ignore meet.coop registrations
        - example: https://git.coop/social.coop/community/operations/-/issues/633
        - check open collective user exists; check it's not obviously spam
        - use labels to track workflow (spam, in progress, approved)
        - we wait for the next two oncalls, then we close as non responsive
    - [[loomio]]
      - most people don't apply to loomio; most people don't do this unfortunately (yet?)
      - but we have to approve applications to the organization as well
      - now I'm an admin so I should get emails about new approvals pending
      - approve if legit and maybe set a social.coop "flair"
    - [[misc]]
      - check admin@social.coop for activity (have it logged in in a separate window)
