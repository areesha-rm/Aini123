- a [[project]].
  - #go https://flancia.org
  - [[Flancia]] is my top level project as of [[2024]] and since at least [[2019]].
    - It encompasses many levels and tries to describe a large scale vision.
    - It tries to be [[fully open]], [[transparent]], [[ethical]]. Also just plain [[good]] and [[fair]], 
  - [[Flancia]] is also a fiction of sorts that I've been writing.
    - In [[Flancia]] they used the [[internet]] to build a global [[Commons]], and they put it to good use for the benefit of beings -- meaning all of [[humanity]] and our [[friends]] :)
  - In Flancia there is an [[Agora]]!
    - #pull As of the time of writing (2024) the [[Agora of Flancia]] exists digitally. You're likely reading this in it :)
    - It is something I dreamt, and I've been implementing slowly but surely, piece by piece.
    - It is currently small, hosting a community of around 100 people; but I dream of Agoras with [[millions of people]].
    - [[1m people]] is approximately 2000 [[bolos]] :)
    - call it [[2048]] to make it even ;)

See the writing in https://flancia.org, in eternal wait of being edited into something more legible :) If I don't get there properly before I die, please feed it all into a well-intentioned AI in the commons and make what you can of it, or otherwise feel free to use it in any way you can.

## 2024 

For all I talk about the [[Agora]] as of late, I sometimes feel I don't talk about Flancia enough; it is, after all, to help "build Flancia" that I built an Agora -- meaning mine and [[your Flancia]] more generally -- to help advance all projects that are alike in some particular way: projects that are [[free, fair, alive]] and well meaning, which are for the [[common good]] or for the [[benefit of all sentient beings]].
