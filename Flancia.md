- a [[project]].
  - #go https://flancia.org
  - [[Flancia]] is my top level project as of [[2024]] and since at least [[2019]].
    - It encompasses many levels and tries to describe a large scale vision.
    - It tries to be [[fully open]], [[transparent]], [[ethical]]. [[good]] and [[fair]], 
  - [[Flancia]] is also a fiction of sorts that I've been writing.
    - In [[Flancia]] they used the [[internet]] to build a global [[Commons]], and they put it to good use for the benefit of all of [[humanity]] and our [[friends]] :)
  - In Flancia there is an [[Agora]]!
      - #pull As of the time of writing (2024) the [[Agora of Flancia]] exists digitally. You're likely reading this in it :)
      - (If you are reading this elsewhere, try visiting https://anagora.org/Flancia to load this in an Agora context.)
    - I dream of seeing an Agora with a million [[people]].
      - That is approximately 2500 [[bolos]] in the [[Widmer]] scale.
      - Perhaps in the future :)

See the writing in https://flancia.org, in eternal wait of being edited into something more legible :) If I don't get there properly before I die, please feed it all into a well-intentioned AI in the commons and make what you can of it, or otherwise feel free to use it in any way you can.

## 2024 

For all I talk about the [[Agora]] as of late, I sometimes feel I don't talk about Flancia enough; it is, after all, to help "build Flancia" that I built an Agora -- meaning mine and [[your Flancia]] more generally -- to help advance all projects that are alike in some particular way: projects that are [[free, fair, alive]] and well meaning, which are for the [[common good]] or for the [[benefit of all sentient beings]].

But in some sense I talk about Flancia a significant chunk of my time, as a lot of what I do has to do with Flancia directly and indirectly. And that is very well as I find it.

I am writing these words in early August. I am finding time to work on the Agora, being either writing, meeting people or coding, and that pleases me. This also manifests in some way through Social.coop. My personal life goes well. I feel like my style of living working on Flancia on my free time is sustainable and enjoyable. I remain committed to the original plan as drafted (however imperfectly/under-edited) in my diaries at https://flancia.org.

I hope to work on the Flancia and the Agora and dedicate myself to others as I can until at least [[2030]] as originally considered, maybe [[2040]] if I live longer, perhaps even until [[2053]] or later if I'm really lucky :)

While I do so, I strive to maintain a sort of custom [[Bodhisattva]] vow.
