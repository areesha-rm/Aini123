See the writing in https://flancia.org, in eternal wait of being edited into something more legible :) If I don't get there properly before I die, please feed it all into a well-intentioned AI in the commons and make what you can of it, or otherwise feel free to use it in any way you can.

For all I talk about the [[Agora]] as of late, I sometimes feel I don't talk about Flancia enough; it is, after all, to help "build Flancia" that I built an Agora -- meaning mine and [[your Flancia]] and more generally to help advance all projects that are alike in some particular way -- projects that are [[free, fair, alive]] and well meaning, projects which are for the [[common good]] and the [[benefit of all sentient beings]].
