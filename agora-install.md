# Agora Install

- Set up a [[personal knowledge management]] system for note taking and upload your notes in [[Markdown]] format to a git repository of your choice.
  - Get a [[github]] account if you don't have a git host already: <https://github.com>.
    - Install [[git]]: <https://git-scm.com/download>.
  - If you don't have a personal knowledge management system of choice, we recommend [[foam]]: <https://foambubble.github.io/foam/>.
    - To use foam, fork its template repository: <https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/>. You can use any name you desire for your repository.
    - Install [[vscode]]: <https://code.visualstudio.com/download>.
    - Launch [[vscode]].
    - Select 'clone repository' -- if you're using [[github]], log in with [[github]]. Authorize [[vscode]] to make changes to your account. It sometimes requires you to retry.
    - [[vscode]] should offer to install recommended extensions. Say yes.
    - You can now use [[foam]]:
      - Press alt-d to start a new daily note (your journal). 
      - Write [[wikilinks]] to link to other pages. 
      - Control-click them to visit existing linked notes or create them if needed.
- Send email to signup@anagora.org or a Twitter DM to [[flancian]] with:
  - The URL of your repo.
  - Your desired username (can be distinct from that of your git host).
  - Confirmation that you agree to the Agora's [[contract]] (only the one by the @agora user; other contracts are optional).
