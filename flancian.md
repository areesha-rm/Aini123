# Flancian

- A [[person]].
  - My [[self]] :).
  - I found, or I'm trying to build, an [[Agora]]: https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1349070105402105856
  - There are many [[Agoras]]. [[This Agora is just an agora]].
- I identify as a [[humanist]], [[rational]], [[liberal]], [[naturalist]], [[secular buddhist]]. 
  - I prefer to [[deconstruct]] these and other [[cluster identities]] whenever it is feasible, though.
  - The [[agora]] is an [[experimental]] [[social network]] in which I try to express my full identity.
- I practice [[open source]] and [[open ethics]] as much as I can.
  - This [[agora]] is, and will always be, [[free]] and [[open source]].
  - I try to follow an explicit personal social [[contract]] that extends and complements that of the [[agora]].
  - I try to be open with my way of living as it has an [[ethical impact]]. This includes being open about how I spend my [[time]] and [[money]].
    - I work for [[Google]] as an [[sre]]
    - I was born in [[Argentina]] and I live in [[Switzerland]].
    - I am a member of [[effective altruism]].
    - I am a member of [[social.coop]].
- In my [[free time]] I practice [[utopian thinking]]; I am an [[amateur utopian]]. 
  - [[Utopias]] are also a genre of [[literature]].
  - I call my [[protopia]] (our [[protopia]]!) [[Flancia]], but the name isn't important.
    - I am a Flancian and this is my [[manifesto]].
    - There are other [[Flancians]].
  - I intend to bring facets of [[Flancia]] into the real world, only as far as they also benefit others, without unilaterally imposing my will.
