- A [[person]].
	- My [[self]] :).
	- I identify as a [[humanist]], [[rational]], [[liberal]], [[naturalist]], [[secular buddhist]]. 
		- I prefer to [[deconstruct]] these and other [[cluster identities]] whenever it is feasible, though.
		- The [[agora]] is an [[experimental]] [[social network]] in which I try to express my integrated identity.
	- I practice [[open source]] and [[open ethics]] as much as I can.
	  - This [[agora]] is, and will always be, [[free]] and [[open source]].
	  - I try to follow an explicit personal social [[contract]] that extends and complements that of the [[agora]].
	  - I try to be open with my way of living as it has an [[ethical impact]]. This includes being open about how I spend my [[time]] and [[money]].
		- I work for [[Google]] as an [[sre]]
		- I was born in [[Argentina]] and I live in [[Switzerland]].
		- I am a member of [[effective altruism]].
		- I am a member of [[social.coop]].
	- In my [[free time]] I practice [[utopian thinking]]; I am an [[amateur utopian]]. 
		- [[Utopias]] are also a genre of [[literature]].
		- I call my [[protopia]] (our [[protopia]]!) [[Flancia]], but the name isn't important.
		- I am a Flancian and this [[agora]] contains my [[manifesto]].
		- I intend to bring facets of [[Flancia]] into the real world, only as far as they also benefit others, without unilaterally imposing my will.
			- [[flancia collective]]
		- I'm trying to build an [[Agora]].
			- There are many [[Agoras]]. [[This Agora is just an agora]].
