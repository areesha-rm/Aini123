	- A [[Buddhist]].
		- I try to dedicate myself [[for the benefit of all beings]].
	- I also identify as a [[humanist]], [[rational]], [[liberal]], [[naturalist]], [[scientist]].
		- (I prefer to [[deconstruct]] these and other [[cluster identities]] whenever it is feasible, though.)
		- The [[Agora]] is an [[experimental social network]] in which I try to express my integrated identity.
	- I practice [[open source]] and [[open ethics]] as much as I can.
		- This [[agora]] is, and will always be, [[free]] and [[open source]].
		- I try to follow an explicit personal social [[contract]] that extends and complements that of the [[agora]].
		- I try to be open with my way of living as it has an [[ethical impact]]. This includes being open about how I spend my [[time]] and [[money]].
		- I work for [[Google]] as a [[site reliability engineer]].
		- I was born in [[Argentina]],  I live in [[Switzerland]].
		- I practice [[effective altruism]].
		- I am a member of [[social.coop]].
		- I consider myself a [[municipalist]].
	- In my [[free time]] I practice [[protopian thinking]]; I am an [[amateur utopian]].
		- [[Utopias]] are a genre of [[literature]] which I'm interested in.
		- A [[protopia]] is an incremental [[utopia]].
		- I call my [[protopia]] (our [[protopia]]!) [[Flancia]], but the name isn't important.
		- I am a Flancian and this [[agora]] contains my [[manifesto]].
		- I intend to bring facets of [[Flancia]] into the real world, only as far as they also benefit others, without unilaterally imposing my will.
			- [[flancia collective]]
		- I'm trying to build an [[Agora]].
			- There are many [[Agoras]]. This Agora is just [[an agora]].
