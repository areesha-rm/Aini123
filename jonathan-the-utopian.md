- Jonathan thinks [[utopoi]] is not persistent; it will live for a while and then die, like an organism. But this applies mostly to the physical part; the digital part might endure.
- Knowing it has an end date actually feels nice.
- [[wittgenstein]]
  - likes that he critized his own work -- I agree.
  - part of his later work is about [[deconstructing]] his earlier work.
