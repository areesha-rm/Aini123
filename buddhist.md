- I consider myself a [[buddhist]].
  - The [[buddhas]] and [[bodhisattvas]] get a lot right.

  - Update (2022): I have read Buddhist scripture and commentary and my opinion of Buddha and his many followers only improved. Buddhist is really a good set of memes overall. It can be patched -- like anything can. But it's the best base I know of.
    - I did grow up in a Catholic country so I carry many [[Christian memes]] for sure. Many are good as well.
