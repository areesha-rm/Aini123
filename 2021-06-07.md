		- I didn't go to this meeting but I'm glad I found the notes, and it seems [[neil]] was there!

Problem: no matter what I do, I always seem to end up with 400+ tabs and no good procedure to garbage collect. I want [[tabfs]] to be part of the solution here, as it lets you run things like `rm *Twitter*`, but for some reason it stopped working again for me. So now I need to decide whether to invest time in getting it working again or doing more manual work; I seem to get one or two of these decisions a day as of late. Things can always be improved.

Thought: security and hackability are in tension. Security can be used as an excuse to reduce hackability; I call that "appeal to security". It can be akin to "think of the children" -- and, like it, sometimes it makes sense and sometimes it doesn't.
