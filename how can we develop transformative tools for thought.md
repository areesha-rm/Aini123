  - on the term [[tools for thought]]
    - [[kenneth iverson]] introduced the term [[tools for thought]] in [[notation as a tool of thought]] regarding [[APL]]
      - but (this is me):
        - â€¦ except he didn't maybe? :) he uses [[tool of thought]] instead, consistently. 
        - The syntagm "for thought" doesn't appear even once in the paper.
        - "of thought" seems to give thought *agency* in a way that is interesting? instead of sounding like the product of the tool.
      - They prefer [[medium for thought]] sometimes though, like to keep their options open. Makes sense.
  - [[memory systems]]
    - [[mnemonic medium]]
    - example: [[quantum country]]
