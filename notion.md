# Notion

- Seemed powerful but when I tried it it didn't have backlinks. I stayed with [[roam]] until switching to [[foam]] for the purpose of building the [[agora]].
- [[go]] notion.so


[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[roam]: roam "Roam"
[foam]: foam "Foam"
[agora]: agora "Agora"
[go]: go "Go"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
