# The Agora Is a Twitter App

- When you create a node in the [[agora]], like this one, you can add a single block with action 'tweet' and the Markdown title of the note will be tweeted out for you.
  - Afterwards, the [[agora]] will show it as a [[backlink]] for your node.

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[agora]: agora "Agora"
[backlink]: backlink "Backlink"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
