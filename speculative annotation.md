Contemporary artists using annotation.

Erasure series by  [[bethany joy collins]]. A trace of language:

[[laura owens]] created a series of emojis that could be downloaded by attendees:

Why do artists annotate?

![[Pasted image 20210621181527.png]]

Motivation. The enjoyment at the margins (or in the overlay?).

About Speculative Annotation.

Speculation references speculative fiction (fantasy, sci fi).

[[Speculation is a form of investigation]]:

Goals: [[direct conversation with primary sources]],  [[share items in a context]]:

Everything is saved in the browser. There's no server.

There is a [[speculative annotation mini collection]].

[[codex]] will like this one:

The project spanned 12 (!) divisions of the library.

User testing.

Then the talk went into amazing examples of annotation by students, which I won't reproduce here as they had written consent to show work by minors and I wouldn't want to breach anyone's consent.

No social support:

Except #AnnotateLOC (could be aggregated in the [[agora]]?).

Activity: we annotate [[the left hand of darkness]]. But first Q&A.

- [[q]] does the tool have a way to take their annotations with them?
	- it's all in browser local storage; there is no server component. but there's no flow to be able to access annotations remotely, and you shouldn't clear your browser cache :)
	- (I wonder if [[ipfs]] or even [[fission]] could be a good fit for this)
- [[q]] what if you had a button to save annotation .png files to the [[internet archive]]?
	- (sounds great to me)
	- [[jaime mears]]
		- would be great, is a matter of funding + time + working through the standards that the library of congress holds for [[pii]]
		- the server really would host just a very lightweight json file essentially. the architecture is sound.
- [[q]] how to get involved?
	- [[jaime mears]]
		- they would love it if people got involved
		- it's all in github
		- reach out!
		- twitter: ?
