Why do artists annotate?

![[Pasted image 20210621181527.png]]

Motivation. The enjoyment at the margins (or in the overlay?).

Speculation references speculative fiction (fantasy, sci fi).

[[Speculation is a form of investigation]]:

User testing.

Except #AnnotateLOC (could be aggregated in the [[agora]]?).
