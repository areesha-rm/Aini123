		- I try to keep a [[journal]] in the [[agora]].
		- Every day, if you want, you can go to the ISO-8601 node for it if you want to read the journals of [[agora]] users: [[2021-01-30]].
		- You can also always visit [[today]] and [[journals]] (many days).
- I usually mean [[today]], a.k.a. [[YYYY-MM-DD]].
  - [[alt-shift-d]] in [[Silvebullet]].
