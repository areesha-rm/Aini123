- #pull [[open letter to an open society]]
	- an [[open letter]].
	- [[meta]] Here I would like to write long form, although [[logseq]] doesn't make it very pretty :)
	  
	  (I can press [[shift enter]] to write paragraphs, but switching to long form full text writing mode like I can in [[obsidian]] or [[hedgedoc]] could be better.)

	- LATER Write about this after I [[edit]] [[flancia.org]].
