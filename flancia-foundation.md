# flancia foundation

- In [[flancia]] we don't believe in hierarchies. We prefer [[heterarchy]] and [[liquid democracy]]. Alas, a legal foundation probably needs to declare a hierarchy. 
- Note the foundation *does not exist as a legal entity currently*. It is my intent to set up one, as per <https://flancia.org/goals>.
- The following is a list of people I would like to invite to the board of the entity. There are no obligations that come with this role as of now.
  - [[luciana]] (president, executor in my absence)
  - [[g. i.]]
  - [[vera]]
  - [[bmann]]
  - [[karlicoss]]
  - [[dan whaley]]
  - [[samuel klein]]
  - [[codex]]
  - [[jonathan the utopian]]
  - [[flancian]] (founder)
