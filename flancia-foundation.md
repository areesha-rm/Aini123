# flancia foundation

- In [[flancia]] we don't believe in hierarchies. We prefer [[heterarchy]] and [[liquid democracy]]. Alas, a legal foundation probably needs to declare a hierarchy. 
- Note the foundation *does not exist as a legal entity currently*. It is my intent to set up one, as per <https://flancia.org/goals>.
- The following is a list of people I would like to invite to the board of the entity. There are no obligations that come with this role as of now, although any member of the board can optionally participate in governance of the foundation through its [[agora]].
  - [[luciana]] (president, executor in my absence)
  - [[g. i.]]
  - [[vera]]
  - [[bmann]]
  - [[karlicoss]]
  - [[dan whaley]]
  - [[samuel klein]]
  - [[codex]]
  - [[jonathan the utopian]]
  - [[armengol]]
  - [[flancian]] (founder)
