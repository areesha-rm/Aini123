# Agora 0.5.1

Improvements:

 - Added notion of 'subnode': a particular note by a particular user. subnodes agregate up to 'nodes': nodes are the set of all subnodes about a given entity (by default, subnodes with the same title).
 - Added users page.
 - Nodes page now lists the size of the node (number of subnodes).
 - Added subnode-viewing mode, in which you can see just notes (files actually) by a particular user (and link to them).
   - Example: <https://anagora.org/subnode/garden/flancian/agora.md>
 - Integrated one more garden, that of [[pen-coded]].
