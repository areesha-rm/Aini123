		- "Welcome to the Capra Course! The lectures will be posted on this page. The first lecture will be released on Wednesday, February 23, 2022, and a new lecture will be released every Wednesday thereafter. By the time the course is completed, there will be 12 lectures released in total."
		- "After the last lecture is released on May 11, 2022, all 12 lectures will be accessible until June 22, 2022. The course will then be closed and alumni will be transferred to our Alumni Network."
		- "Please watch the video for each lecture, read the lecture summary, and then head on over to the Forum for discussion."
		- "You may begin by making connections with other students in the course any time using the forums or by reading the introduction to [[The Systems View of Life]] in preparation for the course."

	- [[lecture 4]] [[the systems view of evolution]]
		- [[summary]]  https://spring.capracourse.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lecture-4-Summary.pdf
		- [[prebiotic evolution]]
		- [[lipid walls]] acted as proto membranes, formed [[bubbles]]
			- within simple bubbles that tended to let some compounds selectively in and keep them in, those compounds collisioned and interacted much more often than without
			- yields [[network chemistry]], highly [[non linear]]
				- ()[[non linear dynamics]], [[complexity theory]] figures prominently.)
			- competition for nutrients yielded [[evolutionary pressure]]
		- [[universal ancestor]] is thought to have come into existence around ~3.5B years ago
			- colonized essentially our whole environment, making future life possible
		- #push [[the systems view of evolution]]
			- [[prebiotic evolution]] plus new understanding of [[biological evolution]]
			- rather than seeing evolution as the result of random mutations, the central focus is on the creativity unfolding of life in forms of increasing complexity of increasing diversity
			- the [[dynamics of life's creativity]]
		- #push [[history of evolutionary thought]]
			- #push [[charles darwin]]
				- based his theory on two core ideas:
					- [[chance variation]] -> [[random mutation]]
					- [[natural selection]]
				- all living organisms are related by common ancestry
				- [[beagle]]
				- Darwin knew not of a remedy to a problem of his theory: he thought heredity worked so that offspring received 50% of the traits of each ancestor, their offspring 25%, theirs 12.5%, etc.
					- Darwin saw this as a flaw as it showed that positive traits would disappear very quickly after arising and being selected by chance.
					- [[Mendel]] of course discovered the units of heredity, [[genes]].
					- [[Mendel]] wrote to [[Darwin]] ()!), and allegedly Darwin didn't read the letter because it was in German and had too much math on it (!).
			- [[radical shift]] in biological thought: from [[being]] to [[becoming]] (a shift towards change)
			- [[holistic view]]
			- #push [[neodarwinism]]
				- evolutionary variations result from random mutations, being random genetic changes, followed by natural selection.
			- #push [[systems view of evolution]]
				- recognizes three major avenues of evolution:
					- [[random mutations]] == [[genetic mutations]]
						- most mutations are harmful, few lead to positive variations
						- note that one bacteria can become [[billions]] in just one day
					- [[horizontal genetic transfer]] == [[gene trading]]
						- [[bacteria]] freely trade genes, swap genes with each other
							- global trading of genes (!)
							- [[lynn margulis]]
						- some [[microbiologists]] argue that [[bacteria]] should not be categorized into [[species]]
						- during the first [[2 billion]] years of evolution, only bacteria were around
						- [[bacteria]] bootstrapped it all, established the global system
						- #push [[bacteria]] also invented:
							- [[fermentation]]
							- [[photosynthesis]]
							- [[nitrogen fixation]]
							- [[rapid motion]]
							- [[respiration]] (!)
					- [[symbiogenesis]]
						- [[evolution through symbiosis]]
						- [[lynn margulis]] as well
							- hypothesis: long term [[symbiosis]] involving [[bacteria]] and other [[microorganisms]] as hosts/guests led to complex life
							- [[acquiring genomes]]
								- compares organisms to [[corporations]]
				- all three of the previous produce changes that need to be integrated into the physical and chemical environment; if the integration of new genetic information doesn't work, the organism can't survive -> there's natural selection
				- [[epigenetic network]]
				- real life example: in human life you make plans (you have a plan for your night), plans need to adapt to random occurrences (people you run into; other events out of your sphere of control). evolution works the same way.
			- #push [[david brower]] narrative: compresses 4.5B years (the [[age of the earth]]) into the six days of [[biblical creation]]
				- [[sunday midnight]] creation
				- [[tuesday 8am]] first bacterial cells
				- [[thursday midnight]] planetary system
				- [[friday 4pm]] sexual reproduction invented
				- [[saturday]] all visible forms of life evolved
					- [[1.30am]] first marine animals
					- [[9.30am]] first plants come ashore
					- [[16.50]] great reptiles, roam for five hours
					- [[17.30]] first mammals
					- [[22]] first primates
					- [[23]] first monkeys
					- [[23:40]] great apes appear
					- [[23:56]] [[homo habilis]]
					- [[23:59:30]] [[homo sapiens]] begins to evolve
					- [[23:59:49]] humans
					- less than one second before midnight: [[written history]]
			- [[australopithecus afarensis]]
				- [[big brains]] seem to have yielded all these innovations [[four million years ago]]:
					- [[language]]
					- [[reflective consciousness]]
					- [[tool making]]
					- [[social]]
			- [[homo habilis]] [[two million years ago]]
			- [[homo erectus]]
			- [[homo sapiens]] [[250k years ago]]
				- [[cro magnon]] -- anatomically identical to us. fully developed [[language]]. brought about an explosion of technological and artistic innovations.
					- [[lascaux cave]]
					- [[chauvet cave]]
						- [[300 paintings]] of high artistic achievement and with a [[narrative]]
	- [[lecture 5]] [[mind and consciousness]]
		- [[summary]] https://spring.capracourse.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Lecture-5-Summary.pdf
		- [[gregory bateson]]
			- [[1960s]] mind as a [[process]]
		- #push [[santiago theory]]
			- [[humberto maturana]]
			- [[francisco varela]]
			- a new conception  of the nature of [[mind]] and [[consciousness]] is an implication of the [[systemic understanding of life]]
				- it goes beyond the [[cartesian division]].
					- [[ren√© descartes]] based his thought on a fundamental division between [[res cogitans]] (the thinking mind) and [[res extensa]] (matter, the extensive thing)
						- [[mind]] as an intangible entity poses the question of how it interacts with matter
				- mind and consciousness are not [[things]], they are [[processes]]
					- [[gregory bateson]] [[mental process]]
					- independently [[humberto maturana]] had similar ideas w.r.t. [[cognition]]
					- [[francisco varela]] worked with him and developed his insights into a theory known as [[santiago theory of cognition]]
						- [[cognitive science]] is a [[transdisciplinary approach]]
						- the process of knowing and the process of life are one and the same
						- [[cognition]] is the activity involved in the self generation and self perpetuation of [[living networks]]
						- the self organizing activity of a living system at all levels is [[mental activity]]
						- the interactions of a living organism with its environment are [[cognitive interactions]]
						- life and cognition are inseparably connected at all levels of life
						- cognitive activity is [[immanent]] in life
					- cognition does not require a brain/nervous system
					-
