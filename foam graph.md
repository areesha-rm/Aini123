# foam graph

- asked in the Foam discord server about graph performance.
- [[riccardo]] "dataviz.ts is probably the best entry point to see how the graph comes together. I am also keen to provide the json output (e.g. via a command) to help with https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues/654 and make it easier for the graph data to be used"
