  - recurring, just show up if interested :) I attend often but not always.
  - we take notes in the Stoa below or sometimes in the Agora at large (in [[journal]] entries).
  - no [[fomo]], no [[stress]]! 
  - with [[loving kindness]]!
	- #when [[Saturdays]] at [[9AM UTC]] (or maybe rather [[11AM ZÃ¼rich]]) by default.
