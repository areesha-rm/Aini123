- [[games]]
- [[reddy]]
  - about to release a [[book]]!
    - a [[playbook]]
  - idea of the book is to put the ideas out there
  - play is *not* gamification
  - play like a child:
    - you don't need to know the rules
    - you don't know who you are playing with, sometimes
    - the outcome is free
  - or like an adult in a research lab
    - which are sometimes as free as the previous
  - vision: libraries and playgrounds -- with playgrounds in the center
  - [[a safe space to be irreverent]]
- [[philosophy]] and [[religion]]
  - movements mostly seem to be [[competin with each other]]
- [[education]]
- [[protopias]]
- [[flancia]]
  - [[agora]]
  - [[flanbridge]]
