- a [[short story]].

Maybe Musk will wake up, you tell yourself. He will realize he's being suboptimal and, somehow within his aspergy self, the realization will arise that he is in need of looking around and updating his policies.

Maybe you will write an open letter to him, and he will actually read it, be it weird or not: [[Open Letter to Elon Musk]].
