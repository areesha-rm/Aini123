# Backlink

- A backlink is any link that links to the URL or node you are currently at.
- If you're reading this in the Agora, you'll see a list of pages that link to this one at the bottom of this page. Those are backlinks.
- Available in many wikis, but brough to prominence as of late by [[roam research]] and [[roam likes]] like [[foam]]. 
- Backlinks are neat because they expose the wider context of a resource (at garden, Agora or internet level) in a way that is resource-independent. You could add backlinks anywhere; you just need an agreed upon protocol to resolve them in a way that makes sense for users.
