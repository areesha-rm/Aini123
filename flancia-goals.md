# flancia goals

- These are our [[goals]]. What are yours?
  - To establish a collective: [[flancia collective]].
  - To build [[an agora]]: this [[agora]], which is hopefully only one of many.
      - This particular Agora is an [[experimental]] [[social network]] assembled around a [[distributed knowledge graph]].
      - It is our [[intent]] for this Agora to function as a commons where people can meet and cooperate on goals in the space of [[world improvement]].
      - We intend to evolve the Agora in directions that [[maximize constructive dialogue]] and [[unlock potential for collaboration]].
  - To do what we can to help conscious beings thrive and reach their ideal target mental states: [[ataraxia]], [[eudaimonia]], [[happiness]], [[enlightenment]].
  - To practice [[effective altruism]].
  - To drive and support a variety of projects of [[public utility]].
    - [[pull]] [[public utility]]
