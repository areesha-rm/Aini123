  It started as a joke, partly a reflection on my own egocentrism. We loved doing [[Yoga with Adriene]] and [[Benji]] but sometimes struggled with poses and transitions; the opportunity to watch ourselves while we were doing [[yoga]] proved too tempting, the webcam was pointed, [[meet]] was opened, then we were off.
  
  From there to recording it was but a step; and from there to [[fractal yoga]], recursively many (just joking -- it was two.)
