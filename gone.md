- a [[poem]].
  - [[Gone]], gone.
    - Gone beyond!
    - Everybody gone to the other shore.
    - Gone kindly!
  - Gone, gone.
    - Gone beyond!
    - Everybody gone to the other shore.
    - [[Awakening]]!

Gone, gone!
Gone beyond

Everybody gone to the other shore

Gone kindly.
If you have to go, go kindly!

Love
Burn kindly!

If you have to burn,
   burn kindly!
