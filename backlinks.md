# Backlinks

- A chunk of the power of [[roam likes]], the other being [[wikilinks]] (not exclusive to them) and [[block references]].
- A backlink is any link *to* the page you're visiting.
- Currently the [[agora]] surfaces backlinks from nodes in the same [[agora]]. In the future it will support sources such as other agoras ([[agora protocol]]) and social networks such as [[twitter]].
