# The Agora Is a Markdown Convention

- It is really important to me that the Agora is as compatible as possible with plain [[Markdown]] as possible.
  - [[Markdown]] is easy to use.
  - I want the [[Agora]] to be [[maximally inclusive]].
- The only extension to [[Markdown]] that the [[Agora]] depends on is [[wikilinks]].


[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[Markdown]: markdown "Markdown"
[Agora]: agora "Agora"
[maximally inclusive]: maximally-inclusive "Maximally Inclusive"
[wikilinks]: wikilinks "Wikilinks"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
