  - an [[nft]] is just a contract in a blockchain.
  - it doesn't solve the problem of hosting the content you are acquiring with the contract.
  - sometimes people sell NFTs that just refer to a centralized URL that breaks/can be made to serve other content
  - [[ipfs]] allows you to refer to a fingerprint that will remain constant
