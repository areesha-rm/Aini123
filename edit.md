# edit
- an [[action]]
	- I want to execute it at least [[weekly]].
	- I've been failing *hard* at this, now trying to come up with a [[plan]].
	- [[push]] [[do]]
		- open flancia.org in a designated tile now and start reading
		- open [[book]] in a designated tile now and choose one section
			- this was the wrong first step :)
			- the right first step is: [[check out flancia repo]]
- a [[journal]]
	- that I try to keep while editing
	- [[pull]] [[pushes]]
	- [[2021-01-07]]
		- [[meta]] what I could implement as a way of setting up [[reinforcement loops]] could help here: push dates (future) to actions, then write in the target context (the action) as a log that 'acks' the incoming pushes -- or don't, and they'll show up as unfulfilled.
