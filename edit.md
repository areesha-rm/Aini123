# edit

- I am trying to run an easy-to-use [[agora editor]] using, as of the time of writing, [[silverbullet]]:
  - #pull https://edit.anagora.org
- an [[action]]
	- I want to execute it at least [[weekly]].
	- I've been failing *hard* at this, now trying to come up with a [[plan]].
	- [[push]] [[do]]
		- NOW open flancia.org in a designated tile now and start reading
		  :LOGBOOK:
		  CLOCK: [2022-03-26 Sat 18:42:57]
		  :END:
		- post progress to
			- [[thread]] https://social.coop/@flancian/108023246863400996
		- open [[book]] in a designated tile now and choose one section
			- this was the wrong first step :)
			- DONE the right first step was: get [[flancia repo]] / [[become dorcas]]
			  :LOGBOOK:
			  CLOCK: [2022-03-26 Sat 18:42:20]--[2022-03-26 Sat 18:42:20] =>  00:00:00
			  :END:
			- also site > book at this point, it's the entry point to the whole thing! people surely stumble onto flancia.org and then *actually read it* as is :)
- a [[journal]]
	- that I try to keep while editing
	- [[pull]] [[pushes]]
	- [[2021-01-07]]
		- [[meta]] what I could implement as a way of setting up [[reinforcement loops]] could help here: push dates (future) to actions, then write in the target context (the action) as a log that 'acks' the incoming pushes -- or don't, and they'll show up as unfulfilled.
	- [[2022-03-26]]
		- [[meta]] wow, I can't believe it's been [[more than a year]] since I wrote that I needed to edit more, then proceeded not to edit.
		- just run [[editing]]
