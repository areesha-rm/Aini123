Indeed!

I know that:

1. hypothes.is can be used to 'host' this kind of cross-site pointer.
2. [[web mentions]] could be used to implement this.
3. the [[chrome]] team at Google are working on adjacent functionality.
4. the [[internet archive]] is working on something similar also.

Would you like to pursue any of these directions? I can look up more information as needed.
