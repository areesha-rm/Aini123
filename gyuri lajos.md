- [[leg district]]
	- like when you go up a hill or mountain and you realize that there's another similar excursion you can start from up top (to the next hill/high)
	- but now apparently out of this! a good time to look back/down, revisit, consider, [[demo]]
	- [[indiehub]] is the main account of Gyuri in the [[fediverse]]
	- [[trailhub]] is the old name for the old approach -- [[indiehub]] is like [[indieweb]] but serverless / highly distributed
		- [[ipfs]], [[hypercore]] and [[holochain]]
			- all building on [[dhts]]
		- [[named data networking]] is the predecessor to these distributed systems
- [[flancian]] agora updates
  - [[agora bot]] -> social media integration
  - community growing, feeling nice!
- [[log]]
 - https://social.coop/@indiehub
 - https://botsin.space/@agora
 - Testing [[agora bot]] functionality
 - Testing using the [[agora]] from Mastodon by using [[wikilinks]] after following @agora@botsin.space.
 - Testing [[indiehub]] - [[agora]] integration :)

	- the 'watching' list is not being updated correctly
- [[orbitdb]]
	- distributed database, append semantics but with removal
	- isomorphic to: distributed [[pubsub]]
- [[wiky]]
