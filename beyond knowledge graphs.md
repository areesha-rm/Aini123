		- a set of coordinates in space that can be assigned to a piece of content.
		- semantic difference -> geometric distance
		- conceptual parallels -> geometrics parallels

		- [[location-based addressing]] vs [[content-based addressing]]
		- if you have an error in your location-based address, that's usually a hard error
		- [[content based addressing]] is very search-engine-like
	- what if we didn't even add titles to our notes (blocks)? perhaps the content itself is the best addressing mechanism
		- embed each document semantically, then work within a radius

	- [[static linking]] vs [[dynamic linking]] (perhaps a bit of a stretch)
		- static linking: you use [[wikilinks]] in a tool like [[roam]] to link out to particular notes
		- dynamic linking:
