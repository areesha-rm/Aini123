    - [[designing semantic spacetimes in five mechanics]]
	- [[push]] [[semantic embeddings]]
		- a set of coordinates in space that can be assigned to a piece of content.
		- semantic difference -> geometric distance
		- conceptual parallels -> geometrics parallels
	- some mechanics
		- [[location-based addressing]] vs [[content-based addressing]]
		- if you have an error in your location-based address, that's usually a hard error
		- [[content based addressing]] is very search-engine-like
	- what if we didn't even add titles to our notes (blocks)? perhaps the content itself is the best addressing mechanism
		- embed each document semantically, then work within a radius
			- (very agora like!)
	- [[static linking]] vs [[dynamic linking]] (perhaps a bit of a stretch)
		- static linking: you use [[wikilinks]] in a tool like [[roam]] to link out to particular notes
		- dynamic linking: you select a fragment of a note and make it into a link
			- the results of the retrieval process depend on an evolving corpus
	- [[time as a first class citizen]]
		- no timestamp involved in at least [[obsidian]] vaults
		- there might be many situations where storing the timestamp of a document could be very useful
		- take the ML space: [[transformer]] happened and it took over a chunk of the space.
		- you get a dimension of understanding when adding the time dimension to your analysis of a space
	- [[mutable entries]] vs [[immutable entries]]
		- if you keep editing mutable entries you need to first search/retrieve/manage changes
		- instead you could *just* add immutable items
		- this is very much like the motivation for [[push]] in the [[agora]], or at least goes very well with it
	- [[contextual retrieval]]
