- Back in [[Silverbullet]] after a few days only making it to [[codium]] -- which in some ways was good, as it means I managed to carve out some time for some playful coding through the week.
  - [[Stapelberg]] is now using [[Silverbullet]] as well and seems to like it as well although he did comment on the system requirements; I agree it can be intense in larger gardens. But still it is capable enough and a solid enough writing environment that it's the best tool I know of in knowledge space currently.
- Work was good, tough at times but I believe overall productive.
  - I've been feeling and looking a bit tired lately so I started taking iron again, and might take vitamin D supplements (as I've been doing seasonally with good effect).
- Tomorrow I'll see [[AG]] :)
- This evening after work I started working on the Agora and writing. [[Lady Burup]] is sitting to my back on her green cushion.
- Someone reached out over [[Telegram]].
- I thought about [[Ekumen]].
