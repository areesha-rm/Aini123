# Pad

- A [[pad]] is a group resource: a common notebook where a group of people may write in.
  - It can be a [[wiki]], a [[google doc]], an [[etherpad]].
- The [[agora]] wants to integrate with all available public pads (that are willing).
  - Each [[agora]] node comes with at least one [[pad]] built in: it is a public, world-writeable text field. You can find it right here below.
  - If you [[pull]] a pad, and by this I mean you write [[pull]] <some url> in the [[agora]], the agora will try to [[transclude]] or [[embed]] it here.
