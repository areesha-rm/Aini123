# Jump

- An [[Agora action]].
- [[agora plan]] I'll implement the action and a 'jump'/ dialog always available in the Agora, perhaps replacing search in the [[toolbar]].
  - Done! [[2021-01-02]]
  - Q: is 'go to' better than jump? I don't think so, and it could be confusing due to go links. But unsure.
