# Jump

- An [[Agora action]].
- Jump is very simple: it encodes a query as a node id (using [[unicode-slugify]], if you're interested) and sends you to the matching node.
  - It's like search, but the results page is a [[node]] -- so it can be [[crowdsourced]].
  - You can add the [[Agora]] as a [[search engine]] in your [[browser]]: https://anagora.org/jump?q=%s
- If you are viewing this in an Agora, you can use jump by typing in the jump box at the top of the page.
