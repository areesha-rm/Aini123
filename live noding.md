- A [[thing]].
  - You write in the Agora while being aware of the fourth dimension and sharing it with others :).

Sharing is caring, the saying goes, and it's actually completely true in some key ways. 

I try to [[live node]] weekly, meaning I write in the Agora of my choosing, the [[Agora of Flancia]], at least during weekends (as during the week I tend [[work]]).

As you read this, it is [[2024-05-03]] -- a Friday. I am listening to [[bobby lyte]] on and in [[flow]].
