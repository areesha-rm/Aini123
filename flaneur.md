# Flaneur

- A [[concept]].
  - [[pull]] You can spell it [[flâneur]] if you're feeling fancy :)
- [[go]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fl%C3%A2neur
  - [[quote]] Flâneur is a French noun referring to a person, literally meaning 'stroller', 'lounger', 'saunterer', or 'loafer', but with some nuanced additional meanings. Flânerie is the act of strolling, with all of its accompanying associations.
  - [[quote]] It was Walter Benjamin, drawing on the poetry of Charles Baudelaire, who made this figure the object of scholarly interest in the 20th century, as an emblematic archetype of urban, modern (even modernist) experience.[1
