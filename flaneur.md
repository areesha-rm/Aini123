  - [[quote]] Flâneur is a French noun referring to a person, literally meaning 'stroller', 'lounger', 'saunterer', or 'loafer', but with some nuanced additional meanings. Flânerie is the act of strolling, with all of its accompanying associations.
- I sometimes write about [[flaneur]], a [[web browser]].
