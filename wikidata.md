  - [[quote]] Each Wikidata entity is identified by an entity ID, which is a number prefixed by a letter.
    - [[items]], also known as Q-items, are prefixed with Q (e.g. Q12345),
    - [[properties]] are prefixed by P (e.g. P569) and
    - [[lexemes]] are prefixed by L (e.g. L1).
- [[wptools]] seems to expose a nice interface 
- [[quote]] Wikidata stores a large number of types of unique identifiers which can be used to disambiguate you from other people with the same name, and on the other hand can unify records about you no matter how your name is provided. These include, (but are not limited to) [[VIAF]], [[ISNI]], [[ORCID]], [[ResearcherID]], [[Scopus]], and [[Google Scholar]].
