    - I've been meditating for about three years now -- going by the post above, which dates from two years ago and says "I've been meditating for about a year now, and for four months seriously.". This is an update as of [[2021-11]].

I feel off the wagon at some point during 2020; it was a very hectic year at work (because of scaling of the product we support needed due to the pandemic) and at some point I convinced myself I didn't have time for it. In retrospect not a great move -- as it would have been obvious had I stopped and thought about it for a minute :)

Since then, I've managed to get back to a regular practice. This amounts to meditating daily, at least ten minutes almost daily, and recently with a target of at least twenty minutes.
