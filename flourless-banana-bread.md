# Flourless Banana Bread

- [[go]] http://annajones.co.uk/recipe/ode-to-wales-banana-bread
  - [[luciana]] did it with no [[caraway seeds]], and [[yacutinga sugar]] instead of [[coconot sugar]].
  - We thought perhaps it could be done with a little less sugar.
  - We plan to make it with coconut sugar later and compare.
