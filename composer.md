# Pete's Composer Overview, 2024-03-05

**Composer** is a team collaboration app that serves some of the same small team use cases for which I use HackMD and Obsidian. Composer seems to work well, but **note well** that it's still at the technology preview level, and DXOS says "data loss may occur" at this stage. So, don't use it for critical work, and/or regularly export data to another tool.

To get started with Composer, click the link at the top here to join the space (if there is one). Or to get a workspace started without joining with anybody else just yet, start at <
https://composer.dxos.org/
> .

Composer's infrastructure is distributed and features real-time collaboration, and it stores data in your browser and in IPFS. You don't create an account. Instead, a key is stored in your browser that lets you access your space. Click on your profile icon in the lower right to edit your name and to add your other devices.

DXOS is a distributed computing platform built by smart, experienced, dedicated people; I know the founder. Read <https://dxos.org/> for some background on DXOS and Composer.

Composer is not the end goal of DXOS; rather, Composer is a demonstration of creating applications on DXOS. As DXOS says, "Composer supports small teams working together on documents, presentations, and data-driven workflows. Users organize data into Spaces, which can be shared with different people."
