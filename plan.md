# Plan

- An [[action]].
  - See also: [[do]].
- I have a plan. I call it [[Flancia]] for short.
  - I intend to dedicate most of my [[free time]] to it.
  - The plan, in a nutshell and if you'll allow me a literary flourish, is a roadmap to [[Flancia]]. Flancia is a [[utopia]], in particular a [[protopia]]: a place that doesn't exist, has good qualities, and could presumably be built through the iterative application of cooperative, rational, optimistic thinking. 
  - My current best-effort rational optimistic thinking leads me to want to focus on engaging in philanthropy within my means while promoting or building [[tools]] for the advancement of knowledge and cooperation.
    - Because of this I'm building an [[Agora]]: a goal-oriented [[social network]] specialized in [[problem solving]].
      - You are probably reading this in some version of it right now.
      - The Agora, at its most basic and general, is a protocol: [[Agora Protocol]].
    - [[Palimpsest]], perhaps a generally interesting feature that might in time help bootstrap the [[Agora]].
      - Whose v1 is probably [[Memex]] or [[hypothes.is]] plus the [[Agora]].
  - My plan seeks to include every social action which makes aspects of my [[identity]] which I consider moral and constructive available to others for judgment or cooperation. That is, I try to be fully open :)
    - My current attitude towards the world is to do the best that I can possibly muster in my public life; being open about my plan is a core part of my identity, as I believe openness as a social attitude results in interactions conducive to optimal understanding and cooperation.
