# Plan

- An [[action]].
- See [[do]].
- I have a plan.
    - This plan has two facets: one internal to my employer, that I can not cover here fully, and one public.
    - The external plan, in a nutshell and if you'll allow me a flourish, is to get to [[Flancia]] :) Flancia is a place built through the cooperative application of rational, positive thinking. I intend to dedicate most of my free time to building it.
    - My current best-effort rational positive thinking leads me to want to focus on engaging in philanthropy within my means while promoting or building [[tools]] for the advancement of knowledge:
        - An [[Agora]], a goal-oriented social network specialized in social problem solving.
            - You are probably in some version of it right now.
            - Whose v1 probably implements the [[Agora Protocol]].
        - [[Palimpsest]], perhaps a generally interesting feature that might in time bootstrap the [[Agora]].
            - Whose v0 is probably [[Memex]] or [[hypothes.is]] plus the [[Agora]].
    - My current attitude towards the world is to do the best that I can possibly muster in my public life; being open about my plan is a core part of my identity, as I believe openness as a social attitude results in interactions conducive to optimal understanding and cooperation.
        - The plan includes by default every social action which makes aspects of my identity which I consider moral and constructive available to others for judgment or cooperation.
