# Plan

- An [[action]].
  - See also: [[do]].
- I have a plan. I call it [[Flancia]] for short.
  - I intend to dedicate most of my [[free time]] to it.
  - The plan, in a nutshell and if you'll allow me a literary flourish, is to write a roadmap to [[Flancia]] with [[you]]. 
  - Flancia is a kind of [[eutopia]]; in particular a [[protopia]]. It is a place that doesn't exist, yet has both contact points with the [[real world]] and some [[good]] qualities. The working [[hypothesis]] is that it presumably could be built through the iterative application of [[cooperative]], [[rational]], [[optimistic]], [[compassionate]] thinking. 
  - My current thinking along the aforementioned lines leads me to want to focus my free time in two ways:
    - Engaging in philanthropy within my means 
    - Promoting and building [[tools]] for the advancement of knowledge and cooperation.
  - Because of the above I'm building an [[Agora]]: a goal-oriented [[experimenta]] [[social network]] specialized in [[problem solving]].
      - You are probably reading this in some version of it right now.
      - The Agora, at its most basic and general, is a protocol: [[Agora Protocol]].
        - I believe [[wikilinks everywhere]], an MVP for the application of the protocol, might have some potential to improve the health of the internet.
      - This plan used to include developing [[palimpsest]], perhaps a generally interesting feature that might in time help bootstrap the [[Agora]]; but I know believe [[hypothes.is]] or [[memex]] are essentially it, and the Agora should interop with them and complement them if at all possible.
  - My plan also includes by default every social action which makes aspects of my [[identity]] which I consider moral and constructive available to others for either judgment or cooperation. In other words, I try to be fully open :)
    - My current attitude towards the world is to do the best that I can possibly muster in my public life; being open about my plan is a core part of my identity, as I believe openness as a social attitude results in interactions conducive to optimal understanding and cooperation.
    - I practice [[open ethics]] and [[open source]].
    - See also: [[contract]].
- Have I ever told you that in [[Flancia]] there is an [[Agora]]?
