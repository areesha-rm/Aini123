- Back to work :)
  - I had the day off but I decided to work anyway; the meeting load seemed manageable and I was able to carve out a good-sized flow block, so it seemed like a good idea to get the week started today.
  - Ended up working half a day, which seemed like a good compromise; I ticked a few things off my todo list to start the week in good shape, freeing the rest for some critical tasks hopefully.
