# agora outage

- the [[agora]] went down significantly today (at least 10 minutes) for the first time I'm aware of since at least the beginning of the year.
  - I've procrastinated on implementing best practices so there's plenty to analyze in this postmortem! I'm looking forward to it.
  - [[you can run an agora in your laptop]]
