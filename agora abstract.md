- I try to write [[abstracts]] for possible [[papers]] related to the [[agora]].
	- This was motivated by [[pkm book]]'s [[call for chapters]]
	- #pull [[agora abstracts]]
	- #0 in flancia there is an agora (perhaps to be read later)
	- #1 the [[agora]] tries to be a minimal viable [[ethical]] [[knowledge commons]]
	- #2 the [[agora]] is a platform that lets you do [[yoga]] for the [[mind]] with others
