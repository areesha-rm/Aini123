# Moa.party

- [[go]] https://moa.party
  - A tool for cross-linking [[mastodon]] and [[twitter]]. [[instagram]] sometimes also works.
  - I set it up on [[2021-01-09]]. It was easy and it works well enough for now!
  - ~~~Unsure about the privacy/security aspects of it honestly. [[research]]~~~
    - [[done]] it looks solid. [[open source]] as expected.
