# Moa.party

- [[go]] https://moa.party
  - A tool for cross-linking [[mastodon]] and [[twitter]]. [[instagram]] sometimes also works.
  - I set it up on [[2021-01-09]]. It was easy and it works well enough for now!
  - As of [[2021-01-13]] it's been rock solid.
- [[open source]]
  - [[by]] [[hypnagogic]]
  - [[github]] https://github.com/foozmeat/moa
    - [[flask]] based, like the [[agora]]. Perhaps there's potential for collaboration/code reuse.
- [[matrix]] https://app.element.io/?pk_vid=2aa9ef53afdcaeaf1609608427b036f4#/room/#moaparty:matrix.org
- As of [[2021-02-07]] part of the [[fedstoa]].
