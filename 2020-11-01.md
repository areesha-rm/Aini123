- Day's todo:
  - Do laundry
  - Talk to family over VC
- [[ding-levery]] told me about [[roam-to-git]].
- [[logseq]] told me about [[force-graph]].
- Met [[kanjun]] on [[twitter]].
- Worked on the [[agora]] for a few hours and it was lots of fun: https://flancia.org/go/agora has the changelog. Got several things working:
  - Listing notes.
  - Finding (multiple) notes by [[wikilink]].
  - Rendering notes (Markdown).
  - Auto-linkification (which Foam does for you).
  - https://anagora.org has this code live now.
- Tomorrow:
  - Implement search (full text).
  - Implement backlinks (of course).
  - Make the index be just another note [[ding-levery]].
  - Help [[s5bug]] and [[jonathan-the-utopian]] integrate.
