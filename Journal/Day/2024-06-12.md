- Back in the Agora, back in Flancia :)
  - The visit from [[Berni]] and the birthday of [[AG]] were beautiful.
  - Now enjoying the rest of the [[week off]]:
    - catching up with housework (deep cleaning mode!)
    - catching up with messages and letters
      - reading and writing invites
      - doing writing in general
    - and [[flow]]!
- Did some maintenance of my computer setup; converged more wayland configs after incorporating a new computer into my [[chezmoi]] setup but dropping templates for reduced complexity.
