- Back in the Agora, back in Flancia :)
  - The visit from [[Berni]] and the birthday of [[AG]] were beautiful.
  - Now enjoying the rest of the [[week off]]:
    - catching up with housework (deep cleaning mode!)
    - catching up with messages and letters
      - reading and writing invites
      - doing writing in general
    - and [[flow]]!
- Did some [[maintenance]] of home and computer setup; converged more [[wayland]] related configs after incorporating a new computer into my [[chezmoi]] setup and doing and taking the occasion to do an interation of improvements.
  - I dropped some templates for reduced complexity, e.g. [[sway.conf]].
  - My computers in this system are currently:
    - [[paramita]] (personal)
    - [[nostromo]] (personal)
    - [[sariputta]]
    - [[guanyin]]
