* Spoke to my mum about birthdays and states of being :)
- Did idea organization/refactoring :)
* Then tried to [[flow]] in [[paramita]] (one of my computers) and [[sariputta]] (another).
- [[agora development]]:
  - Was very fun yesterday! I like fixing bugs and learning more about [[UI]] -- what works and what doesnâ€™t :)
