- Started the day with [[AG]] in the [[balcony]] :)
  - We managed to also do a mini bike tour before she went to the [[Mothers Day]] festivities :)
- Now thinking of:
  - [[patterns]]
    - as per usual you could say :)
  - [[patents]] (don't worry, more in the abstract than anything :)
    - relevant to [[digital capitalism]] surely
  - [[visions]]
  - [[true names]]
- I got a small book by Meister [[Yaw Hwa Chin]] in the Chinese supermarket, I want to check them out.
  - it's titled [[The wisdom, philosophy and education of Buddha and Chinese]]
  - He writes [[AMITOFO]] just before signing; it turns out it's the Chinese spelling of [[Amitabha]] ~ [[Amitayus]].
