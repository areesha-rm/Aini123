  - I think I prefer dates as 'flat hierarchy nodes' overall -- this way I can just link to the date and get to the journal entry.
  - Also most generally this makes it so the convention for gathering journals is just 'look for [[nodes]] whose [[topic]] is a time period show those that fit the current [[context]]'
- [[flancia meet]] with [[bouncepaw]] was great!
