- Another [[day]], another [[node]].
  - Or more than one :)
  - I *definitely* need to work on editing though! On doing more of the actual curation and maintenance of an actual [[digital garden]].
  - In the meantime, thanks for making do with all the rough edges ;)
- Resuming [[Agora development]]:
  - I have a few commits to push to anagora.org this week.
  - I did some [[verschlimmbessern]] on the index to the [[Agora]] on the flight to the US that I never quite pushed -- and better that way :) it needs 'cherrypicking' to put it mildly. It suffered a lot in directness. 
- [[social.coop]]:
  - No [[twg]] meeting this week, will try to continue working on onboarding [[evan]] to the group.
  - I "installed" `alpha.social.coop` using [[coop cloud]] but it's not up yet.
  - [[upkeep]]:
    - You could call it [[life]] ;)
    - [[nostromo]] was getting broken enough that I decided to update Ubuntu to the latest release to unbreak [[wayland]] and some sites in [[chromium]]. It had been long in the making, it's a bit like house cleaning, it can be relaxing after work :)
    - I tried taking the occasion to also [[garbage collect]] tabs/try some new organizational principles in [[paramita]], [[guanyin]] and [[sariputta]].
- [[GPT 4o]] was released yesterday and I got access.
  - Impressive.
  - But it failed to analyze a video I attached on desktop meaningfully though.
