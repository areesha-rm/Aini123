- Started the day with [[AG]], [[Lady Burup]], a quiet [[Flancia meet]] .
- Then did stuff related to the [[Fediverse]] (which I enjoy) and then [[AI]]. Took the day free for exploration essentially and enjoyed it.
- [[Primeval Forest]]
- [[Gemini AI]]
- [[Agora Development]]:
  - It felt good to focus on bug fixes and usability for a while, I'll try to incorporate it into my routine.
  - [[@neil]] brought up interesting topics in [[Agora Discuss]] as usual :)
