- [[social coop]]:
  * [[social coop matrix]]
- I set up [[silverbullet]] over https pointing to my home computer and it's lovely, I can finally edit my [[garden]] from mobile.
  - While [[paramita]] is on at least, but this is great progress; maybe I should point this to [[nostromo]] which is on more often and I can also remotely enable?
  - But longer term I want to move in the direction of garden (and editor) hosting, I'm already using containers for this...
