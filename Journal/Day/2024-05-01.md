- Happy [[International Workers Day]]!
  - The last year flew by in some ways :) I remember attending the festivities/events in ZÃ¼rich yesterday. Looking forward to doing the same today, at least a few hours.
- I got into [[biking]] again and I'm enjoying it tremendously :)
  - We may bike tomorrow with [[AG]].
- I also plan to catch up with [[Berni]]. I have been catching up with friends finally after a hiatus due to [[work]] + [[travel]] and I'm looking forward to the VC!
- [[doxometrist]] told me about [[netwik-obsidian]] as being in [[agora space]]
- [[j0lms]] had good news!
- [[l]] had good news! and we had an interesting conversation
- [[Brunello]], the father of a friend of mine, died last week at [[90]]. I knew him and he seemed like a good and sensitive person. I lighted a candle for him/his memory.
- [[Agora]]!
  - [[Agora development]]:
    - Fixed images, they were broken in prod due to a logger misconfiguration -- thank you [[neil]] for reporting!
    - Made some progress towards fixing git.agor.ai -- [[hypatia]] got into some weird state after running out of disk.
    - Reached out to [[protopian]] to try to unbreak his garden :)
