- [[Lex]]:
  - Listened to [[Sam Harris]] with [[Lex Fridman]] and it reminded me I also like Lex and I think he has lots of potential.
    - Sam came across as a bit more close-minded on some topics than Lex, which tracks with some of the conversations with him I've been listening to him recently -- he is still one of my favourite public persons though. It's just that Lex seems to be more of the "open heart hippie" and in that sense closer to me (at least at times).
  - Then listened to his conversation with [[Joscha Bach]] and it reminded me I like Joscha as well.
