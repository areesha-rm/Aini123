- Back in [[silverbullet]] for [[Flancia]] :)
- Worked, did some deep cleaning.
- Thought of:
  - [[mantras]]
  - "[[emma goldmann]]" :)
    - I received a sticker with an interesting quote but with her name spelled with an extra n.
  - [[Paulus Akademie]]
  - [[Tanka]] poetry

It was an emotional weekend; Saturday being upbeat, Sunday being more meditative and at times low energy but ending well.

Today I worked and had a fully meetings free afternoon as the US was out due to [[memorial day]].

My mum was/is sick (pneumonia again) and that makes me think of death and impermanence. But it's a good occasion to meditate.

I thought of someday maybe picking back up some of the draft short stories I started around [[2017]], like [[Caramel City]], [[Cannazon]] and the one about the [[Wu-Tang Clan]].
