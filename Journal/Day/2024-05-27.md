- Back in [[silverbullet]] for [[Flancia]] :)
- Worked, did some deep cleaning.
- Thought of:
  - [[mantras]]
  - "[[emma goldmann]]" :)
    - I received a sticker with an interesting quote but with her name spelled with an extra n.
  - [[Paulus Akademie]]
  - [[Tanka]] poetry

It was an emotional weekend; Saturday being upbeat, Sunday being more meditative and at times low energy but ending well.

Today I worked and had a fully meetings free afternoon as the US was out due to [[memorial day]].

My mum was/is sick (pneumonia again) and that makes me think of death and impermanence. But it's a good occasion to meditate.

I thought of someday maybe picking back up some of the draft short stories I started around [[2017]], like [[Caramel City]], [[Cannazon]] and the one about the [[Wu-Tang Clan]].

I received a letter about Christianity out of the blue the other day and today I came across it and saw it had a reference to jw.org, which ended up being [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. I have a negative affect towards the organization because of things I have heard about how the doctrine affects the freedom of its members, but the message that I received seemed innocuous enough. Interesting that they didn't include the name of the organization anywhere, just the domain.

I've been meaning to work on:

- [[Agora development]]:
  - try embedding [[edit]] in every node, even though for the time being it will only work for users opted into a very special beta :)
  - add [[star]] action, even a stub, and see how it "feels"
