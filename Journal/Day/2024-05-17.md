* [[silverbullet]]:
  * should open the daily on startup?
  - [[go/daily]] achieves this for me for now ;) e.g. [[go/daily]] or just use the embed in anagora.org/daily.
- going over "old" (and new) notebooks, trying to make sense of the hugely distributed task list they imply :)
  - happy to see that a lot actually happened in the last 1-2 quarters!
  - I'm thinking this could be a nice 'tradition' to reinforce on the [[17ths]], being [[Maitreya day]] ;)
- [[do]]:
  - [[numbers]] pull all number-related actions, e.g. [[557]] (example comes from a notebook) pulls [[hex/557]], [[prime/557]] and any others we have in the future.
  - [[today]] should probably pull today's date instead of redirecting? maybe!
