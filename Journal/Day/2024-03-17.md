- A beautiful Sunday with [[AG]] and [[Lady Burup]] :)
- I spoke to my [[mum]] over [[Meet]] and it was great.
  - A friend of a friend of hers who was [[92]] died this week. She is visiting the friend today to console her and spend time with her; the friend is 92 as well and is having thoughts about death.
  - It would make sense that as you grow old you have more thoughts about death, as it's statistically speaking way more likely.
  - I hope she's [[free from suffering]]!
- Doing some work -- I enjoy working some weekends, it gives me ample time to [[focus]] while still taking it easy / enjoying the moment.
- We took a short (50 minutes roundtrip) but very nice walk as the sun was setting.
- Saw [[12 monkeys]] after many years; certainly for the first time [[after covid]].
