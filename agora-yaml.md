# Agora Yaml

- [[bmann]] suggested adding [[yaml]] support to the [[agora]].
  - [[go]] https://github.com/bmann/bmcgarden/blob/master/agora.yaml
- [[p0]]
  - It will [[unblock]] many things.
  - It is a valuable [[design contribution]] from [[bmann]].
  - https://github.com/flancian/agora/issues/2
- If you add an ```agora.yaml``` to your [[digital garden]] repository you can use it to configure how the [[agora]] integrates it.
- [[push]] [[agora feature requests]]
  - [[idea]] take [[blog posts]] like https://github.com/bmann/bmcgarden/blob/master/_posts/blog/2011-10-11-turning-the-corner-on-ebook-buying.md and integrate them into the date-stripped node, plus perhaps a link from within the date ([[2011-10-11]] in this example).
