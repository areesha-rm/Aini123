  - I usually get into a distracted and unproductive state when I don't notice what's on my mind; I have 'unflushed' context and I tend to ignore it.
  - Example from today: I felt like I needed to do something for a meeting a few hours later and I failed to actually realize it and do it. Result: a few hours of wasted productivity, and a rush fifteen minutes before the meeting to get it done.
