- [[ctzn]] is broken
  - ctznry.com
- [[agora]] governance
  - users control it by coding nodes however they can
  - users control it by proposing changes to its contract
  - users control it by forking and merging agoras
    - it should be one command essentially
  - [[jonathan]]
    - difference in skill between users means difference in power
    - power is held by people who host?
      - yes, I agree. reducing this power, making it easy to host, is a priority.
  - two [[threads]]:
    - what is stimulating from this vision
    - reflecting on the dangers
- how did the presentation for the masters go?!
  - a lot of the discussion that happened with the jury, in particular a philosopher, was centered around

  - western / colonial gestures / white saviour complex
- [[armengol]] the problem of getting things into [[shareable]] state
  - [[flancian]] defaults to sharing all :)
    - [[armengol]] tries to understand *why* he wants to say something, what's behind it; to process, filter, etc.
  - example problem: where should we meet after this? been thinking about [[coordination problems]]; how we relate to [[digital information]].
  - thought about [[rules]] and [[principles]]
    - [[aside]] [[contract]], [[devine-lu-linvega]]'s [[a cheatsheet on discourse]]
    - [[identity principle]] -- in a digital context you are your information as shared in the [[digital ecosystem]]
    - [[fashion]]

  - if we are planning on sharing a [[space]], imposing [[rules]] can be a form of [[violence]]; you are limiting and bending other people's identities
    - rules for the self converges to [[free will]]
  - [[principles]] are a common understanding of something. they can be used in subsets with a purpose.
    - principles could be in [[contract]]
    - when people interact, they try to follow all [[contracts]]
  - [[a cheatsheet on discourse]]
    - three gates
      - [[is it true]]
        - relevant principles:
          - there is no absolute truth
          - reality can be described from many valid subjective perspectives
- [[push]] [[armengol principles]] based on our relationship with information in a digital context
  - [[identity]]
    - [[you are your information as manifested]]
  - [[individuality]]
    - [[each individual has different needs]]
  - [[linkage]] (connectivity?)
    - [[we are a network]]
  - [[contract]] (spatiality?) (commonality?)
    - [[communication]] is only possible when you share common spaces
      - (discussion about definitions of space and communication here)
      - [[do]] discuss [[communication theory]]
  - [[origin]] (synchronicity?)
    - every piece of information has been created at a moment in time
  - [[accumulation]] (historicity?)
    - you can not change the past -- append only
  - [[meaning]] (diachronicity?)
    - you can only connect the dots looking backwards
- [[push]] [[armengol rules]]
  - we are used to working with markdown. it functions as a common space; it is not just the file, but the associated systems to deal with the files and link them.
  - what if we have a place where we can work together on these files.
    - [[stoa]]?
  - if we override the words of others, this is invasive. but if we don't agree on a shared context, communication cannot happen.
