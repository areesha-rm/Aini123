# Crowdsourced Search

- [[pull]] [[agora search]]
- Any [[entity]] can have a [[node]] in the [[Agora]].
  - Search queries are entities.
    - Search queries can also be decomposed in constituent entities for better modeling using a grammar, but that is not strictly necessary.
- The Agora is a [[distributed knowledge graph]] by the people, for the people.
  - Agora [[nodes]] are [[crowdsourced]].
- From the above it seems to follow that the [[Agora]] is a sufficient platform to implement crowdsourced search.
  - You can think of a [[node]] as equivalent to a user-editable search result page for the search query matching the node title.
  - [[go links]] are explicit offerings for relevant links around the internet.
- [[pull]] [[jump]]
