[[digital reading]]: 5 ways of engagement

"when you are sewing, you usually follow a [[pattern]]. if you are more of an expert like a [[project runway]] contestant, you use patterns to guide you. social annotation provides scaffolding to engage with digital text."

[[digital literacy]] development in three parts by [[coiro 2015]]:

The most advanced users have "a self-directed confidence in transforming strategies used in more familiar contexts into new strategies that are more useful in less familiar literacy contexts."

Creation-driven prompts.

"making things visible: annotation and digital pedagogy"

It's an opportunity to have a conversation. It carries some [[risks]].  Social annotation is [[thinking publicly]]. Partnership with [[marginal syllabus]].

Why to annotate? "It's an [[act of love]] because of one's commitment to stay in relationship with the creator and other readers and observers."

Harding's verbs:  ![[Pasted image 20210621194249.png]]

Other readers: ![[Pasted image 20210621194301.png]]

Harding is interested in historical time, sees in numbers. More in the concrete than the abstract.

Debra's comment expresses a knowledge emotion *plus* says what's interesting about it, yet doesn't feel like a forced explanation:

[[courtney kleffman]]: "What occurs before and after the annotation moment also drives how students view its purpose within the learning process. I often ask student to engage in metacognitive reflection post social annotation. It's not graded, but leads to something else."

(great conversation in the panel and in the chat)

[[metacognition]] and [[reflection]]. 

[[paul schacht]] have them look at other people's annotations. Have students rifle through their own past annotations; marks in their books. Try to characterize the marks that they made; think about what they were trying to accomplish

What's your favourite annotation tool?

- [[cherise mcbride]]
	- private tool / [[LMS]] (sp?)
- [[jenae cohn]]
	- note there is implications for handling some of the PII
	- advantages to do this behind a login wall (so in a silo?)
