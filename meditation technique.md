# meditation technique
- a [[process]].
	- #pull [[samatha]] [[vipassana]]
	- [[breath is the palace of buddha]]
	- While meditating I sometimes do variations on [[box breathing]] combined with [[counting]].
		- It's maybe a bit idiosyncratic but it helps me focus; I'll write more about it in this node.
		- It's important to let go of the process after a while, instead of becoming [[attached]] to the counting.
	- While I [[breathe]], I sometimes visualize a box.
		- I started by using [[single time]] to count with the help of this box.
			- On breathing in, I count and optionally visualize a number inside or near the box as I go up the leftmost edge.
			- On not yet breathing out, I go right through the upper edge.
			- On breathing out, I go down the rightmost edge.
				- While I do this, optionally, I [[factorize]] the number or evaluate it according to some well known function.
				- If the number is known to be prime, optionally, I calculate its multiples until I start another breath.
					- If some multiple is known to be interesting, I stop there and make a mental note of where I stopped.
					- [[119]] is known to be interesting, for example, because it was the first multiple of [[17]] which I found interesting in one particular run through this process.
						- It was the first number that I couldn't decide as prime or composite based on some procedure simpler than knowing it was a multiple of 17.
		- On occasion I find it useful to [[double time]].
			- That means, to count up when
