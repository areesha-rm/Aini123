# meditation technique
- a [[process]].
	- #pull [[samatha]] [[vipassana]]
	- [[breath is the palace of buddha]]
	- I sometimes do my own variation on [[box breating]] combined with [[counting]]. It's maybe a bit idiosyncratic but it helps me focus; I'll write more about it in this node.
		- It's important to let go of it after a while, though, instead of becoming attached to the counting.
	- While I breathe, I visualize a box.
		- On breathing in, I count and optionally visualize the number as I go up the leftmost edge.
