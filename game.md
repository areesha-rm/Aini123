- a [[device]].
  - [[Flancia]] is a [[game]].
    - We're slowly building a game. The [[agora]] can be seen as part of its [[engine]], which is the [[internet]].
    - It is [[open source]]. Content is [[crowd sourced]]. That is, it is what you, [[reader]] or [[writer]], want to make of it.
      - It is inspired by [[infocom]], [[lucasfilm games]] and [[wiki]] culture.
