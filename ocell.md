- Our cat: https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1325024046346539008/photo/1
- A Spanish shelter cat. We adopted her when she was a bit over a year old.
- We picked her up in Brugg on [[2020-11-07]].
- Technically her name is masculine (it means "bird" in Catalan) but I don't think she cares about grammatical gender.
