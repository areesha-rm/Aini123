# Ocell

- Our cat: https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1325024046346539008/photo/1
- The picture below is from shortly after we met her. We picked her up in Brugg on [[2020-11-07]].
- A Spanish shelter cat. We adopted her when she was one year old.
- Technically her name is masculine (it means "bird" in Catalan) but I don't think she cares about grammatical gender.
