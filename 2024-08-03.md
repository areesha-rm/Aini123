* Now on the third :)

-- 

- #push [[story]]

I was thinking about things yesterday and I thought: that's a third. A third most interesting thing, I mean: if I were to introduce a person to three concepts, and give then names, what would those be?

I've known some good first two for a while now. One example:

- [[Agora]]
- [[Moloch]]

Meaning two items that are interesting to describe, that describe things that you might want to have a name for, just because it helps with coordination.

But then you ask yourself: who's the third in that sequence?

I say it's:

- [[Avalokiteshvara]]
