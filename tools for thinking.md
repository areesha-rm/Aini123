## [[How Do We Define Tools for Thinking and Why Do They Matter?]]
- [[john borthwick]] [[jerry michalski]]
- [[john borthwick]]
  - How can a [[computer]] be a better [[tool for thinking]]?
  - The word information -> better forming our minds.
  - How to take all the [[ideas]] of a flow of information and analyzing them as they influence the world.
  - What can we do with well tuned datasets??
  - [[open protocols]]
  - all the data could be owned by people contributing it, against the recent trend towards [[silos]]
  - [[Associative thinking]]; [[scaffolding]] them together; let them simmer in our brains.
    - Taking a walk, going to sleep.
    - Scaffold, then [[sleep]].
- [[jerry michalski]]
  - was introduced to his now wife as the [[biggest brain]] on the internet, high expectations :)
  - [[protocol]]
    - [[jazz hands]] means agreement
    - [[downward jazz]] means disagreement
  - #push [[thebrain]] ~ [[the brain]]
    - #push [[jerry's brain]]
      - one [[mindmap]] since [[1997]], this dec will be [[25]] years
      - #go https://jerrysbrain.com
    - [[one million]] thoughts
    - [[dioramas]] out of [[toothpicks]]
    - [[opinions]]
    - [[hypercard]] could have been the future (might be still!)
      - [[bubble charter]]
      - long standing addiction to the tool
    - [[demo]]
      - [[mind mapping]]
      - [[visual analysis tools]]
      - [[mapping tools for thinking]]
    - [[team mode]] is not what he'd like
    - how to allow different people to use different tools, yet still create an aggregated insight
  - we're dumber than we normally would be
    - [[kardashians]] family details vs [[politics]], how we focus our attention
    - building a [[shared memory]] is a piece in the puzzle we need to solve to make society better
    - [[better recall]] leads to [[reinforcement]]
  - two more points
    - [[zettelkasten]]
    - [[roam cult]] ~ [[the cult of roam]]
  - [[civilizational]] aspect to this 
    - [[open access]] influencing research, journalism, politics and governance
    - #push [[agora]]
      - [[making better decisions together as a society]]
  - first thing recorded was [[theatre]]
    - put the camera on a [[dolly]] and you get the vocabulary of cinema (pans, â€¦)
    - [[internet]] is stuck in v1
    - we have not levelled up because of [[drm]] and other constraints
    - we need to liberate it and instrument it or make it [[executable]]

## [[Inflection Points for Tools for Thinking]]
- [[john borthwick]]
    - introduces [[daniel doyon]] [[tristan homsi]] 
- #push [[readwise]]
  - [[daniel doyon]] [[tristan homsi]] 
  - [[superhuman]]
  - passion for: [[reading]] and [[spaced repetition]]
  - how to improve [[reading]] the same way computers improved [[writing]]
  - tool to [[resurface]] (-> [[reinforce]])
  - started with [[zapier]]
- [[john borthwick]] where do you see us by the end of the decade?
  - belief that there will be a lot of change in this space
  - when they started, [[evernote]] was the most popular request -- that's changed a lot since then
  - on a macro level
    - (missed one beat here I think)
    - paradigm shift with #push [[notion]] (2017-2020), block based architecture
      - other innovation: [[multiplayer]]
    - then #push [[roam]] (blew up in 2021), first somewhat mainstream [[graph database]]
      - [[backlinks]] and [[transclusion]]
      - [[daily notes]] page
    - then many tools coming online, but no clear next item of big innovation
      - #push [[agora]]
        - waiting for the next [[inflection point]]
  - why did [[evernote]] get stuck?
    - they nailed the [[consumer]] use case, never were able to do [[enterprise]] like [[notion]] did
      - that held them back relative to notion
    - they got very distracted in the middle of the growth, they were developing a [[recipe app]]
    - they fumbled their way
  - one of the promises of the internet:
    - you can just build anything, no need to ask for permission (if you have the basic resources, etc.)
    - [[notion]] raised VC, a million or two before going mainstream
    - [[roam]] raised very little before really growing
    - #push [[readwise]] didn't want to raise any money, unsure of the venture scale
      - started charging a monthly fee for a consumer product (shock! :)), now can support a small team
      - [[bootstrapped]]
    - if you don't have the enterprise use case and are consumer based instead, it's unclear how sustainable you can be a priori (-> in the current landscape; but that might be ripe for a change, enough people *want* a way out of walled gardens, want a choice.)
  - [[q&a]]
    - [[anki]] for writing?
      - have been exploring something, dogfood
      - [[theme reviews]]
      - some people do this:
        - [[word vomit]] the start of an essay
        - delineate [[fragments]], do theme reviews (on key terms?) over weeks
          - -> [[wikilinks]]?
        - then [[sequence]]]
      - [[repeat]]
        - you can get to 80% of the work fast this way
    - how does this compare to [[gpt-3]] generation? asker feels that AI based suggestions aren't really that great
      - can't speak about better/worse, but for some people this might feel easier
  - [[core thesis for ai]]
    - the AI can't be the product
    - you won't print an essay ghost written by [[gpt-3]]
      - -> yet? what about the recent paper that *was* written by [[gpt-3]], and for which they got first [[authorship]]?
  - [[john borthwick]] many silos enforcing separation between ideas; also a risk of being fascinated by the technology or the tool
    - [[jerry michalski]] is a good example of focusing on the thoughts, on the information, going beyond the [[tool]]
    - it feels like the space has gone [[mainstream]] now
      - but we're really still in the [[early adopter]] phase
  - [[audio]]?
    - grown a lot in audio
    - 15-20% a year (check?)
    - transforming audio to a block or a highlight: there are early attempts, podcasting [[air]] or [[snipped]] (?)
    - not a seamless experience
  - [[uncanny valley]]
    - [[transcripts]] almost at human level but not quite
    - but it seems like [[text to speech]] and [[speech to text]] can be assumed to be coming, you can probably assume that transcripts for everything will be available
  - #push [[amazon]]
    - one company is controlling ebooks and is making it hard to innovate (if I got that right?)
  - bet: innovation more likely either on [[podcast]] side or [[text to speech]]
  - [[john borthwick]] the downsides of [[silos]]
    - [[readwise]] has done a great job at getting at least [[highlight]] access
    - [[betaworks]] did [[findings]]
      - founders: [[spiritual predecessor]] of [[readwise]]
  - #q over the last n years the [[tools for thought]] space has been changing; how has usage of your tool changed with that?
    - started with [[srs]]
    - started with [[kindle]] highlights, disentangling and making useful
    - there was a period when people thought they would do anything in a particular tool, like [[roam]]
      - people were trying to get *everything* into [[roam]]: putting documents in blocks there to be able to annotate them.
      - that has [[cooled down]]
    - at some point they asked: what's the number one feature we need to implement to actually make money, charge for it?
      - [[evernote]] was the first big one, that would not be the case before
    - [[tweet threads]] 
      - the user of [[twitter]] has helped advance the space
  - #q if you did [[enterprise]], what would you do?
    - [[consumer vs enterprise]]
      - vs
        - [[single player]] vs [[multiplayer]]
    - enterprise is in the back of their minds, but it's not currently core
    - enterprise saas is a great business model though, but there's not as clear an enterprise vision for now
  - #q on [[information density]] are people reading slower? it takes twice as long to listen than to read
    - attention is more often split when listening
    - less information absorbed when people are listening
    - are you able to unplug and read for, say, 20 minutes?
    - "throw all your technology away, go into a cottage and read paper"
      - the problem can probably be solved this way, but that's not feasible actually
      - "fight technology with technology"
      - maybe it's good to be able to read on your smartphone, how do you accomplish that?
      - [[emergent reading]] (?)
  - #q it seems you're in the position of [[owning the plumbing]]: can you lean into that, are you blocked by the players in this space?
    - it would be great to have an [[open standard]]
    - [[annotations]] [[hypothesis]]
      - [[chrome]] has started to add a little bit to it
      - but it's very [[web focused]]
    - (the stream glitched for me here, lost about a minute)
- [[john borthwick]] on the [[knowledge blob]]: it should be transportable
  - they had to come up with their own core abstractions when developing their reading app.
  - why don't we build on top of a [[block]] architecture]]?
  - "like it was the fashion at the time" :)
    - metaphor from user feedback: no, it doesn't really work, it's too soupy (?)
    - it felt "too liquid"
    - how to turn [[fluid thoughts]] into [[coherent text]]
      - [[blocks]] -> [[docs]]
    - [[document]] ~ [[doc]]
      - you have [[blocks]] and [[docs]]
      - imagine your thoughts being injected into a doc
    - meaning exchange for [[knowledge blobs]]
      - annotation
      - highlight
      - notes that you take while reading
    - when you want to read a 120 tweet thread, you actually want to see that as a [[document]] that you can [[annotate]] as a whole
- #q on the toolchain aspect of the [[plumbing]]: love how you can jump from tool to tool. How much effort do you put into customizing the ingestion engines? On the Enterprise side: would love [[readwise]] for [[slack]] :)
  - hacked into something like the latter :)
    - -> I think bots like [[agora bot]] are sufficient?
  - [[jinja]] seemed to solve all problems for customization cross tool
    - [[low floor, high ceiling approach]]
    - -> interesting, [[agora protocol]] seems related
- #q Use cases in education; have you been thought about getting involved with schools? Have you thought about the impact of adoption by students who could be forced to use it? :)
  - Education just hasn't been something they've been successful at, haven't found a way to penetrate that field.
    - -> [[hypothes.is]] collaboration?

## [[Demo: Protocol Design for Tools for Thinking]]
- [[gordon brander]] on [[subconscious]]
  - (87 people watching at this point in time)
  - actually talking about something on a larger scale than [[subconscious]]
  - the internet is already a tool for thought
  - we've gone through [[sense making crises]] several times on a historical level
  - we're going through another and we'll need to get through it
    - [[planet scale challenges]]
      - [[climate crisis]]
      - [[kardashev]] [[type 3 civilizations]]
      - #push [[protopoi]]
        - space of [[possible futures]]
      - outcome is a function of how we learn to [[think together]]
      - thinking together as a [[whole planet]]
      - -> [[gordon brander]] is [[building an Agora]]!
    - #push [[flanbook]]
      - [[apps]] trap [[thoughts]] in [[saas silos]]
      - no way to think as a species
    - #push [[agora protocol]]
      - [[a protocol for thought]]
    - some of the [[old dreams]]: 
      - [[xanadu]]
      - what if we could all contribute to the same space together?
      - they were heavy lift back then
      - but we've made some technical progress!
      - [[noosphere]] ~ [[agora]]
    - took some time off here to post about this to social networks: [[gordon brander]] is building an [[agora]]! they don't call it that, but that doesn't matter. It looks technically advanced too.
    - [[memos]] are a really flexible data structure
      - (super-thoughts? preceded them?)
      - very generic content: they are essentially [[envelopes]] that can carry anything
      - [[envelope]] has:
        - [[header metadata]] 
        - a pointer to some content on [[ipfs]]
        - a pointer to the previous version on [[ipfs]]
        - things just don't disappear anymore
      - [[ucan]] authorizes apps to manage data on your behalf
        - can allow us to build a [[self sovereign]] security model
        - you own your keys, you put them in a [[wallet]]
        - fits [[passwordless sign on]] ~ [[passkeys]]
        - you [[own your identity]], very important to them
        - leverages [[did]] and such
      - [[sphere servers]] are [[superpeers]]. personal [[ipfs gateways]].
        - [[gossip network]]

## [[The History and Future of Software as Tools for Thinking]]
- (missed the first minute)
- [[jerry michalski]] with [[howard rheingold]]
  - how do communities work? how do we get smarter humans?
  - pass the floor
  - (split screen with [[jerry's brain]])
- [[howard rheingold]]
  - [[palo alto research center]]
  - went there for [[alan kay]]'s article for [[scientific american]]
    - [[microelectronics in the personal computer]]
    - if you weren't in [[xerox parc]] you just didn't have what he showed on screen
    - then [[time magazine]] making the [[personal computer]] [[person of the year]]
      - the [[steves]] standing on the shoulders of giants
    - it didn't come from defense contractors, it didn't come from corporations, it cames from [[individuals]] who used what institutions provided to build tools for thinking
    - [[engelbart]]
    - (missed one name here or two, check recording)
    - [[von neumann]]
    - [[alan turing]]
    - [[boole]]
    - [[lovelace]]
    - [[babbage]]
  - led him to create.
- [[jerry michalski]]
  - [[vannevar bush]] [[memex]]
  - [[howard rheingold]] on [[licklider]] [[1960]]
    - -> shame I can't read Jerry's brain here, I didn't know this name at first clearly :)
  - (echo/[[feedback issues]])
  - [[article]]
    - [[man computer symbiosis]]
  - [[J.C.R. Licklider]] got a position (which one?), had read [[Douglas Engelbart]].
    - [[licklider]] funded (sp?) [[engelbart]]
    - led to [[mother of all demos]]
    - [[integrated systems of humans]] using [[language]], [[artifacts]], [[methodology]], [[training]]
  - [[licklider]] has a [[psychologist]] on staff
    - later involved in [[microdosing]] experiments?
- #q what from the original vision has worked (and maybe we take for granted) and what hasn't (yet)?
  - materialized:
    - pointing and clicking
    - multimedia
  - shared notebook for people working on projects was part of the original demo
  - tried going with [[organizations]] where these tools didn't work out
    - [[a work]]
      - service or product that your enterprise created
    - [[b work]]
      - part of the enterprise that works on improving ability to create that product
    - [[c work]]
      - #push [[agora]]
        - improving your ability to improve
    - vision of [[c work]] done as [[skunkworks]], introducing innovation to [[b work]] sections
