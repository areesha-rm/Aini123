  - #go https://www.betaworks.com/event/render-tools-for-thinking#livestream-section
  - organized by [[betaworks]]
  - I'll be [[scribing]] live, let's see how it goes :)
    - If you're viewing this on anagora.org, you can join in and take notes in the public document ("stoa") below.
    - I'll use one section below per session; I'll probably only do one or two live though.

## [[How Do We Define Tools for Thinking and Why Do They Matter?]]
- [[john borthwick]] [[jerry michalski]]
- [[john borthwick]]
  - How can a [[computer]] be a better [[tool for thinking]]?
  - The word information -> better forming our minds.
  - How to take all the [[ideas]] of a flow of information and analyzing them as they influence the world.
  - What can we do with well tuned datasets??
  - [[open protocols]]
  - all the data could be owned by people contributing it, against the recent trend towards [[silos]]
  - [[Associative thinking]]; [[scaffolding]] them together; let them simmer in our brains.
    - Taking a walk, going to sleep.
    - Scaffold, then [[sleep]].
- [[jerry michalski]]
  - was introduced to his now wife as the [[biggest brain]] on the internet, high expectations :)
  - [[protocol]]
    - [[jazz hands]] means agreement
    - [[downward jazz]] means disagreement
  - #push [[thebrain]] ~ [[the brain]]
    - #push [[jerry's brain]]
      - one [[mindmap]] since [[1997]], this dec will be [[25]] years
      - #go https://jerrysbrain.com
    - [[one million]] thoughts
    - [[dioramas]] out of [[toothpicks]]
    - [[opinions]]
    - [[hypercard]] could have been the future (might be still!)
      - [[bubble charter]]
      - long standing addiction to the tool
    - [[demo]]
      - [[mind mapping]]
      - [[visual analysis tools]]
      - [[mapping tools for thinking]]
    - [[team mode]] is not what he'd like
    - how to allow different people to use different tools, yet still create an aggregated insight
  - we're dumber than we normally would be
    - [[kardashians]] family details vs [[politics]], how we focus our attention
    - building a [[shared memory]] is a piece in the puzzle we need to solve to make society better
    - [[better recall]] leads to [[reinforcement]]
  - two more points
    - [[zettelkasten]]
    - [[roam cult]] ~ [[the cult of roam]]
  - [[civilizational]] aspect to this 
    - [[open access]] influencing research, journalism, politics and governance
    - #push [[agora]]
      - [[making better decisions together as a society]]
  - first thing recorded was [[theatre]]
    - put the camera on a [[dolly]] and you get the vocabulary of cinema (pans, â€¦)
    - [[internet]] is stuck in v1
    - we have not levelled up because of [[drm]] and other constraints
    - we need to liberate it and instrument it or make it [[executable]]

## [[Inflection Points for Tools for Thinking]]
- [[john borthwick]]
    - introduces [[daniel doyon]] [[tristan homsi]] 
- #push [[readwise]]
  - [[daniel doyon]] [[tristan homsi]] 
  - [[superhuman]]
  - passion for: [[reading]] and [[spaced repetition]]
  - how to improve [[reading]] the same way computers improved [[writing]]
  - tool to [[resurface]] (-> [[reinforce]])
  - started with [[zapier]]
- [[john borthwick]] where do you see us by the end of the decade?
  - belief that there will be a lot of change in this space
  - when they started, [[evernote]] was the most popular request -- that's changed a lot since then
  - on a macro level
    - (missed one beat here I think)
    - paradigm shift with #push [[notion]] (2017-2020), block based architecture
      - other innovation: [[multiplayer]]
    - then #push [[roam]] (blew up in 2021), first somewhat mainstream [[graph database]]
      - [[backlinks]] and [[transclusion]]
      - [[daily notes]] page
    - then many tools coming online, but no clear next item of big innovation
      - #push [[agora]]
        - waiting for the next [[inflection point]]
  - why did [[evernote]] get stuck?
    - they nailed the [[consumer]] use case, never were able to do [[enterprise]] like [[notion]] did
      - that held them back relative to notion
    - they got very distracted in the middle of the growth, they were developing a [[recipe app]]
    - they fumbled their way
  - one of the promises of the internet:
    - you can just build anything, no need to ask for permission (if you have the basic resources, etc.)
    - [[notion]] raised VC, a million or two before going mainstream
    - [[roam]] raised very little before really growing
    - #push [[readwise]] didn't want to raise any money, unsure of the venture scale
      - started charging a monthly fee for a consumer product (shock! :)), now can support a small team
      - [[bootstrapped]]
    - if you don't have the enterprise use case and are consumer based instead, it's unclear how sustainable you can be a priori (-> in the current landscape; but that might be ripe for a change, enough people *want* a way out of walled gardens, want a choice.)
  - [[q&a]]
    - [[anki]] for writing?
      - have been exploring something, dogfood
      - [[theme reviews]]
      - some people do this:
        - [[word vomit]] the start of an essay
        - delineate [[fragments]], do theme reviews (on key terms?) over weeks
          - -> [[wikilinks]]?
        - then [[sequence]]]
      - [[repeat]]
        - you can get to 80% of the work fast this way
    - how does this compare to [[gpt-3]] generation? asker feels that AI based suggestions aren't really that great
      - can't speak about better/worse, but for some people this might feel easier
    - [[core thesis for ai]]
      - the AI can't be the product
      - you won't print an essay ghost written by [[gpt-3]]
        - -> yet? what about the recent paper that *was* written by [[gpt-3]], and for which they got first [[authorship]]?
