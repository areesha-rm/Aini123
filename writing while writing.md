- a [[brain dump]].
  - [[some things I wrote while writing]] something else, e.g. [[agora pkg chapter]].

What would you do if you were an archer and you had only two arrows (maybe [[one green, one red]])? Maybe declared to be your only two arrows through reliable prophecy. What would you shoot in the direction of, and how would your time your shots?

What if I die come Monday, I ask myself? And I smile. Then I would have only two days left and I should make them count. Which of course applies to every day in principle.

(I am reminded of the [[secretary problem]], which in my mind could be called the [[fiancee problem]].)

Into the fourth pomodoro already at 15:10, feeling great. I'm glad I'm doing this on the 20th instead of the 27th or the 30th. I feel like I'm living in the future -- always a nice feeling :)

Took a long break, starting fifth pomodoro at 15:55.
--

Oh, I'll [[burn]] if I have to.

I'll burn myself for good if I can and be happy while I do it, or at least [[free from suffering]].

I'm on the seventh, did some [[catharsis]] and thinking on [[consciousness]] with [[daniel dennett]] -- and laundry, which I had planned on doing and wrote down as an intent prior, so that was part of the day's work :)

Now on to [[agora rfcs]].

--

Eight went well :)

Also collected laundry (started in six, so some loss of time, but not major) and in the rest had a bite.

I'm drinking [[mate]].
