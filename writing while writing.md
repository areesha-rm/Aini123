- a [[brain dump]].
  - #push [[writing while you write]]
    - [[some things I wrote while writing]] something else, e.g. [[agora pkg chapter]].

What would you do if you were an archer and you had only two arrows (maybe [[one green, one red]])? Maybe declared to be your only two arrows through reliable prophecy. What would you shoot in the direction of, and how would your time your shots?

What if I die come Monday, I ask myself? And I smile. Then I would have only two days left and I should make them count. Which of course applies to every day in principle.

(I am reminded of the [[secretary problem]], which in my mind could be called the [[fiancee problem]].)

Into the fourth pomodoro already at 15:10, feeling great. I'm glad I'm doing this on the 20th instead of the 27th or the 30th. I feel like I'm living in the future -- always a nice feeling :)

--
Took a long break, starting fifth pomodoro at 15:55.
--

Oh, I'll [[burn]] if I have to.

I'll burn myself for good if I can and be happy while I do it, or at least [[free from suffering]].

--

I'm on the seventh, did some [[catharsis]] and thinking on [[consciousness]] with [[daniel dennett]] -- and laundry, which I had planned on doing and wrote down as an intent prior, so that was part of the day's work :)

Now on to [[agora rfcs]].

--

Eight went well :)

Also collected laundry (started in six, so some loss of time, but not major) and in the rest had a bite.

I'm drinking [[mate]].

Today is Sunday [[2022-08-21]]. I'm back in this node again :)

I've done four pomodoros today, now I'm about to begin my fifth. It's 16:40.

Towards this number I've not counted the 1.5h of solid coworking with [[bouncepaw]] in [[agora meet]] this morning, which happened thanks to him and was great.

(This block could have been a push from my [[daily]], and the Agora could have rendered it as another update in this timeline without too much extra work.)

I noded [[writing pomodoro]], which is one of a kind I'm about to do.

--

Back here on the [[2022-08-28]], happy for it. [[Working in public]] with friends! A [[dream]] come true.

--

Back here on the [[2022-08-31]]. Yesterday I stayed up late finish work before holidays. Today I'm focusing on [[agora doc]], the deliverable for [[agora pkg chapter]].

Did a diagram in [[excalidraw]], checked some references, discussed some feedback with [[st]] in the morning.

Now on to edit for one pomodoro :)

--

[[agora diagrams]] is improving, I'm happy about it. I shared one with [[ladee]] and [[agora discuss]].

--

Here again on [[2022-09-04]] while on the train to Lisbon. There's plenty to do, enough that I could feel overwhelmed, but somehow I mostly feel happy instead. I have this 2h (remaining) trip in front of me and I'll try to make the most of it.

--

The term [[data sovereignty]] as per [[wp]] seems to be mostly taken over already by states?

-> [[digital self-determination]], already noded by [[neil]] :D


(As I write this I listen to [[prizewinning]] by [[Juliana Barwick]].)

[[agora graph]]

Back here while [[today]] resolves to [[2023-12-18]] :)

Finally I've added support for -- resulting in an hr element in the Agora, I think I have a bug, let's see :)
