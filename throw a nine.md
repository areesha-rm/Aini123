- [[whistled]]

Here again on [[2024-06-28]] as I opened this old tab. Some of my Agora notes are truly idiosyncratic and opaque, and this one is a good example :)

I have a vague recollection of what happened that caused me to node this, and it has to do with [[dice]] as maybe you'd expect, and also with [[music]].
