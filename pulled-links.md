# Pulled Links

- Nodes that are specially relevant to the context at hand can be *pulled*. To do this, just add a block using the [[pull]] action:
  - [[pull]] [[pulled nodes]]


[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[pull]: pull "Pull"
[pulled nodes]: pulled-nodes "Pulled Nodes"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
