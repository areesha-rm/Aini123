- Some thoughts on [[children]] which should probably be unsurprising to most people who know me.
  - I like [[children]] in general, but not my potential children in particular I guess. This is why I say I don't want to have kids.
  - If I had [[kids]] I'm pretty sure I'd like them, of course. It's just that I like so many people and things already that I don't see a need to get myself into this state.
