- These are some raw notes taken while trying to set up wiki-alpha.social.coop (and later wiki.social.coop) based off the setup that [[jonny]] did on wiki-dev.social.coop.
- I'm using [[coop cloud]] and [[abra]].
  - Initial setup of [[abra]] on [[hypha]] is not covered here; see [[go/twg/bugs]] for that.
- Copy the database dump and restore:
  - abra app cp wiki-alpha.social.coop mysqldump db:/root/
  - abra app run wiki-alpha.social.coop db /bin/bash
  - mysql -p mediawiki < mysqldump
    - The password for root can be seen with `cat /run/secrets/db_root_password`
