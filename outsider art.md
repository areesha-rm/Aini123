# outsider art

- [[pull]] [[henry darger]]
  - first name I think of when considering this concept.
- [[pull]] [[flancia]]
  - in many ways Flancia is probably outsider art, and that's completely fine.
  - I did study literature / have always been into books but the expansion (sprawl?) from fiction to utopia to protopian framework to social project could probably be said to be outside my field of expertise :)
