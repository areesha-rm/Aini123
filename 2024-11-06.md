- I shipped a fix to wiki.social.coop (the result of coworking with Dan through the week, it was great!)
- I shipped some layout/theme improvements to anagora.org, it felt great as well. I like UI stuff actually it seems, in the right dosage.
- I worked and I was a bit tired at times but it was good and interesting.
