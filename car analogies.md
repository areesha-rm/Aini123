Imagine you inherited a [[race car]], slightly battered and in need of upgrades but overall sound.

Then a friend would come about and say: this is a good race car. I know a good driver. We should fix this race car, enter races together, and win them.

Then another friend would come about and say: this is a good race car built of valuable parts. We should put it in the market whole, or strip it for parts and sell them.

Then another friend would come about and say: this is a good race car built of valuable metal. We should melt it and sell it as such.

The first friend is "good" capitalism, or the capitalism that capitalists say we have. The second friend is hypocritical capitalism, or the one I believe we see more often in practice. The third friend is dumb capitalism, which you can also spot in the wild.

Which kind of capitalism runs the companies you know?
