# tortilla de papas

- a [[recipe]]
  - not very well quantified as I learnt this from my family.
  - fry or optionally (I prefer this) [[caramelize onions]]
    - I dice [[n]] large [[onions]], then put them on medium-low heat over n tablespoons of [[olive oil]], and add n *teaspoons* of salt. stir every three minutes (I set timers) until golden brown.
    - (caramelized onions are great, if you do enough you can also make [[mujaddara]].)
  - dice [[potatoes]], I don't peel them because I'm lazy and I don't care but feel free to :)
    - about quantities: I'll weigh them next time I make this and update this recipe with references in grams. I'd say n large potatoes will work, or 2*n if they are small.
    - traditionally: deep fry these, this is optimal for taste and texture but uses a lot of oil and might be less healthy.
    - my take as of late: toss the cubes in olive oil and salt and roast in the oven at high temperature, with fan on if you have it, until nicely golden and tender.
  - take the result of the above and combine in a bowl with six beaten [[eggs]], add a bit of salt and pepper
  - on a pre heated non stick pan with just some oil (you can reuse the pan you used to cook the onions just fine), add the mixture. lower to medium heat and cover (the cover should be larger than the pan). Cook for [[three minutes]], then test for mobility by rotating the pan; you can help the tortilla unstick with utensils, but often it'll rotate nicely on its own just by jerking it about a bit. 
  - use the cover to flip the tortilla; it's ok if it breaks a bit, as half of it will be still uncooked and thus will be able to 'heal'. After flipping cook for 3-5 more minutes depending on taste (I like eating it 'juicy', so partly raw still).
