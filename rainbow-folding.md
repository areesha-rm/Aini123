# Rainbow Folding

- [[go]] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dqimY1OsCA
- A [[song]] by [[heinali]].
- I consider it the [[theme]] for the [[Agora]]. 
  - I listen to it often when I try to "go in", if you know what I mean. When I try to achieve [[flow]], for example.


[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[go]: go "Go"
[Agora]: agora "Agora"
[flow]: flow "Flow"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
