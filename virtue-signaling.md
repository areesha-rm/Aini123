# Virtue Signaling

- To try to communicate virtue by example.
- Can be seen as preachy or empty, sometimes it surely is.
- [[Pro-social]] and [[constructive]], so virtuous.
  - Signaling virtue is pro-social because it communicates ideas for being good and allows them to propragate.
  - Signaling virtue is constructive because it allows good people to find [[others]] and [[cooperate]].
