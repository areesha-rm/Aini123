- Checked [[daily]].
  - Also discussed it with [[1c3k1n9]].
- Somehow managed to get a meetings free afternoon at work! Will try to make it count.
- Yesterday moved my chromoting sessions to VNC.
  - Pro: faster, better quality (colors in particular), lighter memory wise on my laptop.
  - [ ] Con: clipboard sharing doesn't work although it seems like it should. Using TigerVNC both on server and client sides. Need to dig into this. [[todo]]
