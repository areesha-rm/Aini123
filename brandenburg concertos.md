  - "For those who don't know about the story behind Bach's Brandenburg concertos.  In 1721, Bach composed six “concertos for various instruments”. He dedicated them to a German nobleman and sent the manuscript as a gift, hoping to land a job as the court composer in Brandenburg.  The nobleman never replied. Bach eventually took another job in Leipzig, where he lived for the rest of his life.  The 6 concertos were lost for 130 years.  They were never performed. The manuscript was eventually sold for about $20 and shelved in a library.  The Brandenburg Concertos sat there until 1849, when they were discovered and published for the first time.  Thank god."
