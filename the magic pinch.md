# the magic pinch

- impressive way to [[fold t shirts]], but it has downsides when considering the end result:
  - you can't rotate it or translate it safely in any direction without it becoming entangled due to how the sleeve ends up tucked under
  - it *is* very fast
  - you *can* do rotate/move if you know which way you rotate/move in relation w.r.t. how it was folded, so it's a good pro move
