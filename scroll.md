> Scroll is different than other static site generators in 3 ways.
> Instead of Markdown, Scroll uses the easily extendible Scrolldown, so you can invent new languages to better fit your content.
> Instead of supporting licenses, Scroll is 100% focused on public domain sites and everything is designed with that assumption.
> The default Scroll theme publishes all articles to a single page, so readers can read faster at a higher level, like reading a newspaper.
