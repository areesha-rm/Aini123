# Agora Install

- To contribute to the [[Agora]], you need to write down notes or posts in [[Markdown format]] and upload your notes to a ***git repository*** of your choice. These steps are expanded below.
  - Get a [[github]] account if you don't have a git host already: <https://github.com>.
    - Install [[git]] if needed: <https://git-scm.com/download>. It should be installed by default in [[linux]], comes bundled with [[mac os]].
  - If you don't have a [[personal knowledge management]] system of choice to manage your notes, we currently recommend [[obsidian]]. [[foam]] also works well.
  - See [[agora editor]] for alternatives.
- Then send email to signup@anagora.org or a Twitter DM to [[flancian]] with:
  - The URL of your repo.
  - Your desired username (can be distinct from that of your git host).
  - Confirmation that you agree to the Agora's [[contract]] (only the one by the @agora user; other contracts are optional).
- Non-git sources and formats other than [[Markdown]] will be supported in the future; if you store your notes using some other system, please reach out.
- See also (needs updating): [agora howto](https://anagora.org/go/agora-howto).
