# Flancia

- [[go]] https://flancia.org
- A [[place]].
  - The land of the [[Flancians]].
  - It is a world much like ours in many ways, but in which everybody [[thrives]].
  - [[Flancia]] is an amateur [[utopia]]. You could very well think of it as a [[place]] in my mind. 
    - In particular a [[eutopia]] and [[protopia]]. 
  - In Flancia there are many [[polis]].
  - In Flancia there are many bolos [[bolo]].
- I am a [[Flancian]] and this is my manifesto:
  - In [[Flancia]] there is no [[poverty]].
  - In [[Flancia]] there is no [[privilege]].
  - In [[Flancia]] we will one day [[meet]].
- Flancia is a world in which everybody tries to act rationally, honestly, charitably, compassively.
  - You can help others by volunteering [[time]] and [[resources]] as you can. By being [[solidary]].
  - You can help others by trying to [[change the world]].
  - You can help others by [[being open]].

Have I ever told you that in Flancia there is an [[Agora]]? I tell people often, and I'm always fearing it will be annoying if I overdo it. I do it
