# Flancia

- A [[book]] we're trying to write.
  - [[pull]] [[book]].
- One of many [[places]] in our mind.
  - Its [[class]] is [[protopia]].
  - The world of the [[Flancians]]. A world similar to ours, but [[incrementally better]].
  - I am a [[Flancian]] and this is my manifesto:
    - In [[Flancia]] there is no [[poverty]].
    - In [[Flancia]] there is no [[privilege]].
    - In [[Flancia]] we may one day [[meet]].
	- In Flancia there is an [[Agora]].
  - Flancians strive to be [[honest]], [[charitable]], [[compassive]], [[solidary]], [[ethical]], [[prosocial]].
	  - I strive to be a [[rational]] [[cooperativist]], but you don't have to play the same class.
	  - [[In my Flancia, people dedicate a meaningful fraction of their free time and resources to help others]].
	  - I posit that Flancia is a place where everybody [[thrives]].
	  - [[In my Flancia we cooperate our way to an international liquid democratic federation]]. 
			- default policy is [[heterarchy]] through [[distributed]] [[liquid democracy]].
	  - [[In my Flancia cooperatives win late capitalism]].
- an [[organization]].

  - [[pull]] [[flancia collective]]
  - Flancia existed before the [[agora]] but is in the limit defined by how the agora is used by the members of the collective, and the outgroups with which they interact.
- a [[set]].
  - Of [[people]] and [[things]] contained therein.
- A [[collective]].
  - [[flancia collective]]
 - Many other things.
