# Flancia

- A [[book]] we're trying to write.
  - [[push]] [[book]].
		- [[Flancia]], or with a little help from my [[friends]].
- A [[place]] in our minds.
	- A [[protopia]].
	- The world of the [[Flancians]] could be said to be similar to ours, the result of evolution over a material relity that sometimes allows for things to be made better with the application of effort towards achieving an [[incremental improvement]].
		- I am a [[Flancian]] and this is my manifesto:
			- In [[Flancia]] there is no [[poverty]].
			- In [[Flancia]] there is no [[violence]].
			- In [[Flancia]] we will one day [[meet]].
	- Flancians strive to be [[honest]], [[charitable]], [[compassive]], [[solidary]], [[ethical]], [[prosocial]].
		- In Flancia there is an [[Agora]].
		- I strive to be a [[rational]] [[cooperativist]], but you don't have to play the same class.
		- [[In my Flancia, people dedicate a meaningful fraction of their free time and resources to help others]].
		- In Flancia everybody [[thrives]].
	- [[In Flancia we cooperate our way to an international liquid democratic federation]]. 
		- Our default policy is [[heterarchy]] as defined through [[distributed]] [[liquid democracy]].
		- In my Flancia, [[cooperatives and collectives upgrade capitalism]].
- an [[organization]].
  - [[go]] https://flancia.org
  - [[pull]] [[flancia collective]]
  - Flancia existed before the [[agora]] but is in the limit defined by how the agora is used by the members of the collective, and the outgroups with which they interact.
- a [[set]].
  - of [[people]] and [[things]].
 - a [[graph]].
	 - In [[an agora]].
	- Many other things.
