# Flancia

- [[go]] https://flancia.org
- A [[place]].
  - An amateur [[utopia]]; in particular a [[protopia]]. You could very well think of it as a place in my mind. 
- The land of the [[Flancians]].
- See also: [[Flancia narrative]].
- Flancia could be a [[polis]].
- Flancia could be a digital [[bolo]].
 Flancia is a world in which everybody tries to act rationally, honestly, charitably, compassively.
  - You can help others by volunteering [[time]] and [[resources]] as you can. By being [[solidary]].
  - You can help others by trying to [[change the world]].
  - You can help others by [[being open]].
- I am a [[Flancian]] and this is my manifesto:
  - In [[Flancia]] there is no [[poverty]].
  - In [[Flancia]] there is no [[privilege]].
  - In [[Flancia]] we will one day [[meet]].
- (Have I ever told *you* that in Flancia there is an [[Agora]]?)
