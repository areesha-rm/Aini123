# Flancia

- a [[place]].
	- [[protopia]] 
		- in my [[my mind]].
	- The world after the [[flancian revolution]].
		- The world of the [[flancians]] could be said to be similar to ours, the result of evolution over a material reality that sometimes allows for things to be made better with the application of effort towards the achievement of an [[incremental improvement]].
		- Flancia is, I believe, a place that exists as an hypothetical shared future. 
		- At the very least Flancia exists in the [[multiverse]].
- a [[thing]].
	- [[project]].
		- [[go]] https://flancia.org
		- I am a [[Flancian]] and this [[Agora]] has my [[manifesto]].
		- Flancia existed before the Agora but is in the limit defined by how the [[agora]] can be put to use towards the [[thriving]] of all [[conscious beings]] via the exercise of [[altruism]] and the incremental unlocking of [[public utility]].
	- [[pull]] [[flancia collective]]
		- runs the [[reference agora]].
- a [[set]].
	- of [[people]] and [[things]].
	- the [[agora]] is in it.
  - [[book]]
		- [[Flancia]], or with a little help from my [[friends]].
		- [[Flancia]], or [[building bridges]].
