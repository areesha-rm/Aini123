# Flancia

- My amateur [[utopia]]. You could very well think of it as a place in my mind.
- Flancia is a [[polis]].
- Flancia is a digital [[bolo]].
- Flancia is a world in which everybody that is able to help others, does so, some of their time.
- See also: [[Flancia (narrative)]].
- Have I ever told you in Flancia there is an [[Agora]]?
