# Flancia

- A [[book]] I'm trying to write.
  - [[pull]] [[book]].
- A [[place]] in my mind.
  - A [[protopia]].
  - The world of the [[Flancians]]. A world similar to ours but also much unlike.
  - In Flancia there are many [[bolos]].
  - In Flancia there is an [[agora]].
  - I am a [[Flancian]] and this is my manifesto:
    - In [[Flancia]] there is no [[poverty]].
    - In [[Flancia]] there is no [[privilege]].
    - In [[Flancia]] we will one day [[meet]].
  - In Flancia people try to act [[honestly]], [[charitably]], [[compassively]], [[ethically]], [[pro-socially]],[[ cooperatively]], [[rationally]].
  - In Flancia everybody [[thrives]].
  - In Flancia, people dedicate a fraction of their free time and resources to help others.
    - by volunteering [[time]] and [[resources]] as they can. 
    - by being [[solidary]].
    - by being [[charitable]].
    - by [[being open]].
    - by practicing [[empathy]] and [[forgiveness]].
    - by trying to explore [[protopoi]].
  - In [[Flancia]] cooperative groups thrive through [[federation]] and rational government.
    - [[distributed]] [[heterarchy]] through [[liquid democracy]].
- a [[blog]].
  - [[go]] https://flancia.org
  - Flancia existed before the [[agora]] but is defined by it.
- a [[list]].
  - Of [[people]] and [[things]] contained therein.
- A [[collective]].
