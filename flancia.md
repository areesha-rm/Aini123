# Flancia

- A [[book]] I'm trying to write.
  - [[go]] https://flancia.org
  - [[Flancia]] is a [[protopia]].
  - [[pull]] [[book]].
- A [[place]] in my mind.
  - The world of the [[Flancians]]. A world similar to ours but also much unlike.
  - In Flancia there are many [[polis]].
  - In Flancia there are some [[bolos]].
  - I am a [[Flancian]] and this is my manifesto:
    - In [[Flancia]] there is no [[poverty]].
    - In [[Flancia]] there is no [[privilege]].
    - In [[Flancia]] we will one day [[meet]].
  - In Flancia people try to act [[honestly]], [[charitably]], [[compassively]], [[ethically]], [[pro-socially]],[[ cooperatively]], [[rationally]].
  - In Flancia everybody [[thrives]].
  - In Flancia, people dedicate a fraction of their free time and resources to help others.
    - They help others by volunteering [[time]] and [[resources]] as they can. 
    - They help others by being [[solidary]].
    - They help others by being [[charitable]].
    - They help others by [[being open]].
    - They help others by [[forgiving]] them.
    - They help others by never giving up on trying to [[change the world]] for [[good]].
    - In [[Flancia]] you and me join a [[revolution]].
