# Flancia

- a [[place]].
	- [[protopia]] 
		- in my [[my mind]].
	- The world after the [[flancian revolution]].
		- The world of the [[flancians]] could be said to be similar to ours, the result of evolution over a material reality that sometimes allows for things to be made better with the application of effort towards the achievement of an [[incremental improvement]].
		- Flancia is, I believe, a place that exists as an hypothetical shared future. 
		- At the very least Flancia exists in the [[multiverse]].
- a [[thing]].
	- a [[project]].
		- [[go]] https://flancia.org
		- I am a [[Flancian]] and this [[Agora]] contains my [[manifesto]].
		- Flancia existed before the Agora but is, I believe, defined in the limit by how the [[Agora]] is put to use towards maximizing [[thriving]] for all [[conscious beings]] via the incremental unlocking of [[public utility]] and the practice of [[altruism]].
		- [[flancia collective]] runs the [[reference agora]].
- a [[set]].
	- of [[people]] and [[things]].
  	- (the [[Agora]] is in it.)
