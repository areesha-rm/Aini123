# Flancia

- A [[place]] in my mind.
	- A [[protopia]].
	- The world after the [[Flancian revolution]].
	- The world of the [[Flancians]] could be said to be similar to ours, the result of evolution over a material reality that sometimes allows for things to be made better with the application of effort towards the achievement of an [[incremental improvement]].
	- Flancia is, I believe, a place that exists as an hypothetical shared future. Flancia exists in the [[multiverse]].
- a [[thing]].
  - [[go]] https://flancia.org
  - I am a [[flancian]] and the [[Agora]] contains my [[manifesto]].
	- Flancia existed before this [[agora]] but is in the limit defined by how it can be put to use towards a state of higher [[public utility]] by the [[flancians]].
	- [[pull]] [[flancia collective]]

- a [[set]].
	- of [[people]] and [[things]].
	- the [[agora]] is in it.
- a [[project]].
