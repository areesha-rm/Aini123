# Flancia

- A [[book]] we're trying to write.
  - [[push]] [[book]].
		- [[Flancia]], or with a little help from my [[friends]].
- A [[place]] in our minds.
	- A [[protopia]].
	- The world of the [[Flancians]] could be said to be similar to ours, the result of evolution over a material reality that sometimes allows for things to be made better with the application of effort towards the achievement of an [[incremental improvement]].
	- Flancia is, I believe, a place that exists as an hypothetical shared future. Flancia exists in the [[multiverse]].
- a [[thing]].
  - [[go]] https://flancia.org
  - I am a [[flancian]] and the [[Agora]] contains my [[manifesto]].
		- Flancia existed before this [[agora]] but is in the limit defined by how it can be put to use towards a state of higher [[public utility]] by the [[flancians]].
	- [[pull]] [[flancia collective]]
		- runs the [[reference agora]].
	- a [[set]].
		- of [[people]] and [[things]].
		- a [[subset]].
		- of the [[agora]].
