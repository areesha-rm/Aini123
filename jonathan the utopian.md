### [[2021-02-28]]
- [[presentation]] [[mtr master konzept v2021 02 21]]
  - Want feedback on their impressions. Which images, thoughts they receive when the presentation takes place.
  - Any red flags/warnings/concerns we should think about?
  - Suggestions, materials, ideas that could help.
- [[run 0]]
  - project is called [[protopoi]]; a working title.
  - "it feels different to discuss" -- perhaps discuss should have a direct object? it takes only indirect objects/qualifiers here.
  - [[protopian questions]]
    - what are visions of what I want or wish for?
    - what are possibilities that I can imagine, for the near future or the present?
    - what factors condition and inform my relationship to these questions?
    - what are processes by which I can shape my interaction with these questions?
    - in which ways can contrsuctive and collaborative first steps grow out of such processes?
  - [[what I want to do]]
    - this slide went over a bit fast?
    - [[workshop formats]]
    - [[pattern language]]
  - [[wishes and interests]]
    - perhaps start with 'with' and then do 'without'?
      - without
        - 'being overwhelmed' -> 'overwhelming'? it should match disengaging/disengaged
        - limits of our knowledge
        - 'bothers me' -> can bother people?
      - with 
        - it would be interesting to insert "flash forwards" here: say which of these topics you'll expound on later in the presentation, which ones you intend to cover within your project later
        - systemic organization: nice.
    - [[complex topics]]
      - nice
      - went a bit fast as a slide
      - how to generate a list of this type?
    - pluralistic conception of protopia
      - this slide seems a bit "flat"; it could be more tree-shaped perhaps?
      - why is pluralistic separated from the rest by whitespace? unclear
      - [[meaningful]] seems like it's important and could be more stressed
    - [[beyond a discursive approach]]
      - too many slides titled "wishes and interests". "beyond a discursive approach" could be the title of this one?
      - [[aside]] do you know [[keith johnstone]] / [[impro]]?
    - [[forms and shapes for social processes]]
      - [[shapes are formed by social agreements and structural constraints]] could be at the top?
    - [[push]] [[bohmian dialogue]] framework
      - distinction between [[discussion]] and [[dialogue]]
      - [[be brief]]
      - [[speak from the heart]]
      - [[listen as you'd like to be listened to]]
    - [[push]] [[pattern languages]]
      - a design methodology which identifies and abstracts elementary design problems, along with possible solutions for them, and assembles them into a sort of alphabet to be used as a toolbook
      - example: [[group works]]
        - for [[facilitators]] and other participants
        - is this [[free]]?
      - example: [[a pattern language]]
    - [[loose pieces]] 
      - thoughts and open questions
      - [[poetics]] [[spoken word]]
      - [[theater]]
      - [[role playing]]
      - [[tools]] [[wiki]]
      - other [[projects]]
        - locally [[ifkd]] [[dezentrum]] [[park platz]] [[urban equipe]]
        - online [[protopoi network]]
      - [[aside]] this is another slide that could benefit from a bit more structure.
    - [[push]] [[protopoi]]
      - [[questions]]
        - how does success look like?
        - how can we measure it or evaluate it?
        - how to distinguish between something that effects positive change vs something that reinforces problems?
        - what are ways that protopian processes could translate into actions / changes? 
        - what are the tools we can use?
- overall
  - there could have been a bit more meta: go over the structure of the presentation in 30s-60s at the beginning, so the audience knows what to expect.

- [[jitsi meet]]
- [[map of the fediverse]]
- [[security through obscurity]]
- which modeling problems you get excited about?
  - [[flancian]] anything [[graphs]] perhaps :)
  - [[jonathan]] technical problem solving mode is just one mode, but tend to gravitate to higher levels of abstraction
- how do you [[pitch]] your project to people?
  - [[jonathan]] usually say a couple of key concepts: applied utopia, protopia, protopoi
  - [[q]] do you have an umbrella term when you think about it?
    - is it "my master's project"
- [[a pattern language for protopian processes]] 
  - comment from a friend: it might be wrong metodologically to 'fix' the tool to be a *pattern* language at this stage, there are many kinds of language
- how to organize [[todo]].

    - Building [[spaces]].
    - [[pattern languaguages]].
  - [[flancian]] a [[root node]] for all [[protopias]] everywhere :)
  - what is [[protopoi]]?
    - [[flancian]] the [[space]] of all [[protopias]]?
      - an [[index]]
    - [[jonathan]] a [[vision]] of how the [[world]] could be?
      - a [[space]] in the sense of a [[container]] and [[home]] for [[events]] and [[experiments]] which test certain kinds of [[processes]] that are about questioning the [[status quo]] and exploring how to change it incrementally and constructively
        - questioning the status quo can be an [[introspective]], [[meditative]] activity
  - [[jonathan]] the [[project]] is focused on a [[process]] for imagining and exploring [[protopoi]]
  - a [[repository]] of [[projects]] following a theme or vision.

  - [[quote]] We will read from some works of the architect and design theorist Christopher Alexander, with the aim of getting to know the ideas and philosophy associated with the influential book "A pattern language". The term "pattern language" describes an approach to (architectural) design which identifies and abstracts elementary yet ubiquitous design problems, along with solutions for them, and assembles them into a sort of alphabet to be used as a toolbox. 
  - [[quote]] This methodology is embedded in a design philosophy which attempts to put humans' needs, desires, and "aliveness" at the center of the design process. Although coming from architecture and urban design, Christopher Alexander's work has aspects which are of a very general, conceptual nature. It has been an influence in other fields, such as software design and music, and perhaps this module can be an opportunity to explore possible inspirations within one's own disciplinary context.
  - [[quote]] Proposed readings: excerpts from the following books by Christopher Alexander: "Notes on the Synthesis of Form"; "The Timeless Way of Building"; "A Pattern Language". Possibly also additional materials.
  - [[the timeless way of building]]
  - [[a pattern language]]
  - [[notes on the synthesis of form]]
- [[feedback]] on [[priorities]] with [[agora feature request]] and [[agora plan]]
  - [[chat]] per [[node]] plus [[multiple fanout]]
  - [[flancian]] I should get a blackboard

### [[2021-01-01]]
- Super cool that you have a blackboard in your room! 
- VC is very inclusive and we can always have this, no matter where we live.
- What have you been working on?
  - [[jonathan]] working a lot on the online course at [[eth]]. Sort of managing the project almost.
    - [[flancian]] do you feel like you are learning at the day job?
    - yep. Experimenting with new mediums for [[online teaching]].
    - [[category theory for engineers]]
      - [[flancian]] related to [[category theory for programmers]]?
      - Different target audience: these are engineers in the sense of mechanical engineering, aerospace. Less direct mappings here.
      - Main applicational framework: [[complex systems]] + [[modeling]], [[design]], [[optimization]].
- [[world models]]
- [[utopoi]]
- [[projections]]
  - [[flancian]] does the word make sense?
  - [[jonathan]] yes. but [[filtering]] may be less confusing.
- [[agora]]
  - [[users]]
  - [[groups]]
    - node [[bourbaki]]
  - [[stoas]]
- [[pivoting]]
  - [[push]] [[braiding]]
    - something is [[symmetric]] if [[braiding twice is identity]]
    - [[braid]] [[hofstadter]] 
  - [[twist]]
- [[agora]] for [[utopia]]
  - [[missing devices]] 
  - [[utopoi]]
    - [[flancian]] set of [[m prime]]
      - [[jonathan]] mathematical + computational approach to the world
        - on the one hand it seems it will always miss something, as life is so rich
        - on the other hand it seems it could be valuable
        - at the beginning it seems it could be unpractical, but looking around similar approaches are around
        - it is very costly to input lots of information, and it requires a lot of time
      - [[flancian]] note that the value/cost function is undefined; this is a procedure to find paths/tunnels
  - [[utopoi]]
    - [[jonathan]] a project that wants to build channels with related projects, one of this is this repository; but it is not exactly the same.
    - [[repository]] sounds static, whereas the [[m prime]] approach sounds more like a [[machine]].
    - [[jonathan]] [[noded]] [[utopia studies]]
    - [[flancian]] I liked [[topiary]]
- [[focus]]
- [[robin krom]]
  - [[jonathan]] thinks [[robin krom]] could be interested; related to [[category theory]], [[smart contracts]], [[financial markets]], [[liquid democracy]].
- [[reading group]]
- [[bug report]] [[agora plan]] https://anagora.org/node/reading-goup---christopher-alexander renders badly

### [[2020-12-18]]
- Jonathan thinks [[utopoi]] is not persistent; it will live for a while and then die, like an organism. But this applies mostly to the physical part; the digital part might endure.
- Knowing it has an end date actually feels nice.
- [[wittgenstein]]
  - likes that he critized his own work -- I agree.
  - part of his later work is about [[deconstructing]] his earlier work.
### [[2020-12-12]]
- "philosophy is the art of making questions enjoyable"
- pros/cons
- "feeling like a mashed potato"
- work is getting stressful due to an online course coming up in January.
