# Agora Feeds

- [[push]] [[agora plan]]
  - The [[agora]] should support [[rss]] / [[atom]] feeds in two ways:
    - As a [[consumer]], to easily allow any feed producer to volunteer subnodes in an [[agora]].
      - I see this as part of the [[agora bridge]] effort.
    - As a [[producer]], to easily allow users and other systems to consume [[agora]] updates.
- [[push]] [[python]] libraries
  - [[atoma]]
  - [[feedparser]]
