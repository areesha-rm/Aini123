- Interesting that in [[Silverbullet]] linking to a date and then visiting it doesn't do the "right" thing in some sense, as it doesn't navigate to the journal entry but rather to the node about the date.
  - In some ways this is the correct thing, as that's the behavior I use elsewhere to get to the journal.
  - But by default alt-shift-d goes to Journal/Day/<date>
