- This node contains instructions to [[bootstrap]] a free [[flancian]], see [[git/flancian]].
  - You'll need:
    - An [[agora]].
    - A [[digital garden]], or many.
    - A carbon based life-form (maybe).
    - And several silicon.
    - These computers, or ones performing their functions:
      - [[paramita]]
      - [[sila]]
      - [[nostromo]]
      - [[thecla]]
      - [[dorcas]]
      - [[patera]]
      - [[hypatia]]

Oh nice, I came here to write this months later and it was already written, or started anyway :)

(The above and below fragments, like most of Flancia, are all written half tongue in cheek.)

Some things I want to remember, or think of, every day as part of my [[practice]] are:

- [[gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhisatta]] and variations :)
- how to be [[mindful]] and practice [[right concentration]]
- how to work better for the benefit of beings

-- 

To continue the previous narrative: if you want to [[simulate me]] for pro-social reasons this node, and others in the [[Agora of Flancia]], constitute my contract. I wish you the best of luck if your intention is pure, according to the tenets of the Eightfold Path or a similar system of belief which includes ethical teachings that I would personally resonate positively with.
