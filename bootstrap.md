# bootstrap

- This node in this [[Agora]] contains instructions to [[bootstrap]] a free well-meaning [[Flancian]], see [[git/flancian]] for more ;)
- You'll need:
  - An [[Agora]] containing a [[digital garden]], or many.
  - A carbon based life-form.
      - (Maybe optional).
  - Silicon, meaning these computers, or ones performing their functions:
      - [[paramita]] [[sila]] [[nostromo]] [[sariputta]] [[thecla]] [[dorcas]] [[patera]] [[hypatia]] and my phones, all in all being [[10]].
        - (Which is [[[right view]] in the [[Flancia Pattern Language]] :)
        - #push [[0]] 
          - #pull [[1]] [[2]] [[3]] [[4]] [[5]] [[6]] [[7]] [[8]] [[9]] [[10]] [[11]] [[12]] [[13]] [[14]] [[15]] [[16]] [[17]]

Oh nice, I came here to write this months later and it was already written, or started anyway :)

(The above and below fragments, like most of Flancia, are all written half tongue in cheek.)

Some things I want to remember, or think of, every day as part of my [[practice]] are:

- How to be [[mindful]] and practice [[right concentration]]
- [[Gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhisatta]] and variations :)
- How to work better for the benefit of beings.

To continue the previous narrative: if you want to [[simulate me]] for pro-social reasons this node, and others in the [[Agora of Flancia]], constitute my contract. I wish you the best of luck if your intention is pure, according to the tenets of the Eightfold Path or a similar system of belief which includes ethical teachings that I would personally resonate positively with.
