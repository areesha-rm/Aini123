  - You'll need:
    - An [[agora]].
    - A [[digital garden]], or many.
    - A carbon based life-form (maybe).
    - And several silicon.
    - These computers, or ones performing their functions:
      - [[paramita]]
      - [[sila]]
      - [[nostromo]]
      - [[thecla]]
      - [[dorcas]]
      - [[patera]]
      - [[hypatia]]
