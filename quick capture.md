# Quick Capture

- [[roam]] has a quick capture mode that compensates for the lack of a mobile client. It worked well enough.
- I'd been missing a way to capture/edit [[Agora]] notes from mobile.
  - [[gitjournal]] is the best way I've found so far.


[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[roam]: roam "Roam"
[agora]: agora "Agora"
[gitjournal]: gitjournal "Gitjournal"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
