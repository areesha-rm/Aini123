- [[Silverbullet]]:
  - The new [[Silverbullet]] supports transclusion!
    - It works using the syntax I think [[Obsidian]] also uses:
    - ![[tabs]] will transclude the content of note [[tabs]].
    - In the case of the [[Agora]] this *could* be treated as a [[pull]] -- but that transcludes the whole node below the current one, and maybe in this case what is intended is to transclude one particular resource in-place.
    - Oh, what currently happens is that the Agora assumes this is an image being transcluded -- that is the one kind of direct transclusion we have implemented so far. I guess I could hack that codepath and see how hard it is
  - In other [[Silverbullet]] news, today I figured out how to make dailies go to the node YYYY-MM-DD instead of to Journals/Day/YYYY-MM-DD:
    - You open special page `/Library/Journal/New%20Page/Daily%20Note` (template) in your instance.
    - You change suggestedName.
    - I commented out forPrefix but I'm unsure if you need that.
