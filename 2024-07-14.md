- The new [[Silverbullet]] supports transclusion!
  - It works using the syntax I think [[Obsidian]] also uses:
  - ![[tabs]] will transclude the content of note [[tabs]].
  - In the case of the [[Agora]] this *could* be treated as a [[pull]] -- but that transcludes the whole node below the current one, and maybe in this case what is intended is to transclude one particular resource in-place.
