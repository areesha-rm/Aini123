# Distributed

- A [[network]] where each node can route to many others, and in which there is no topological [[hierarchy]].
- When applied to [[systems]], it means that computation or processing takes place in more than one server, node or location; and that there is no recognizable hierarchical 'root' in the resulting network.
- See also: [[decentralized]], [[centralized]].
- This [[agora]] is meant to be part of a distributed network: https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1339872745832800256
