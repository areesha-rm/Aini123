# Open Ethics

- [[open source]] for [[humans]].
- Applying the spirit of [[open source]] to our lives.
  - Being fully explicit within our capabilities.
- To [[do]] what you [[say]].
- To maintain a public [[contract]] that tells the world who you are, who you want to be, who you [[intend]] to be. How you define [[good]] and [[bad]]; [[interesting]] and [[lacking interest]]; [[fun]] or [[boring]].
