# Open Ethics

- [[open source]] for [[humans]].
- Applying the spirit of [[open source]] to our lives.
  - Being fully explicit within our capabilities.
- To [[do]] what you [[say]].
- I try to [[embody]] this quality by maintaining a public [[contract]] that tells the world who I am, who I want to be, who I [[intend]] to be. 
  - Also how I define [[good]] and [[bad]]; [[interesting]] and [[uninteresting]]; [[fun]] and [[boring]].
