# Distributed Knowledge Graph

- A [[graph]] where [[nodes]] are [[entities]] and [[edges]] are [[social]], [[semantic]], [[logical]] [[relationships]].
  - Such a graph, in general, is by definition [[social]].
  - [[pull]] [[social-knowledge-graph]]
 - [[push]] [[what is a distributed knowledge graph]]
  -  [[go]] https://notes.knowledgefutures.org/pub/belji1gd/release/2
  -  by [[joel gustafson]] of the [[knowledge futures group]].
- The [[agora]] is built around one, or is an interface to many, depending of how you look at it.
  - It is an [[integrated repository]] of [[digital gardens]].
  - I strive to integrate it as well as I can with the [[federated ecosystem]].
