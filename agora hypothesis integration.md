# Agora Hypothesis Integration

- Interesting I didn't have this node until [[2020-12-12]].
- [[hypothes.is]] could be a great platform to implement [[agora comments]].
  - Trivially: each node could redirect to a via.hypothes.is URL for commenting inline.
- [[hypothes.is]] could be an [[agora client]]:
  - an interface to query your notes and [[Agora]] nodes in an Agora of your choice.
  - an interface for [[wikilinks everywhere]].
- [x] [[do]] try embedding hypothesis in the Agora: https://web.hypothes.is/for-publishers/#embedding
- [[pull]] [[agora hypothesis]]
