- Had a great conversation with [[s5bug]] and [[vera]] in [[agora development matrix]].
  - [[agora plan]]
  - [[agora ext]]
  - [[agora bot]]
  - [[node outlines]]
- [[full throttle]]
  - [[duncan jones]]
- [[vera]] [[democractic confederalism]]
- [[s5bug]] [[what is flancia like]] https://twitter.com/s5bug/status/1348730049596334081
- [[push]] [[day]]
  - the [[week]]:
    - [[monday]]
    - [[tuesday]]
    - [[wednesday]] [[what I do with my time on wednesdays]]
    - [[thursday]]
    - [[friday]]
    - [[saturday]]
    - [[sunday]]
- [[today]]
  - [[work]]
- [[push]] [[mastodon]]
  - I think it's picking up steam, at least in my [[social circle]].
  - I find it a bit silly that [[tweets]] in [[mastodon]] are called [[toots]].
    - [[Is]] it [[in an [[endearing]] way]]?
  - [[mastodon instances]]
    - [[social.coop]]
    - [[tilde.web]]
    - [[shelling]] == [[shelling.pt]]
  - [[mastodon clients]] by [[s5bug]]: https://social.coop/web/statuses/105544494599375454
    - [[mastodon]]
    - [[pleroma]]
    - [[miskey]] [[favourite]]
- [[push]] [[action]] 
  - push is the action that links [[2021-01-12]] and [[day]]: because 2021-01-12 includes a block with [[push]] [[day]], [[day]] gets that block and its children as content -- a lightweight form of [[transclusion]].
  - [[action]] accordingly also gets these blocks as a result of the push above.
