# Algorithm

- Underneath and above, enveloping and permeating an [[agora]] is an [[algorithm]].
  - The [[algorithm]] of the [[agora]] is the set of best known [[procedures]] to improve the [[world]], scheduled [[rationally]] and [[compassionately]].
- When in doubt, think of the algorithm. Consider the following questions.
  - What am I supposed to be doing right now? According to whom?
  - What is the most urgent thing I need to solve? Is there anything I would want to have done later today? Check my calendar now.
  - Have I reviewed my [[daily]] routine?
  - Am I concentrated? Am I unable to focus?
- Construct a [[dag]] that represents a set of activities to perform. 
  - If there are circular dependencies, write down examples here in this note. Unsure if circular dependencies come up in human-level tasks very often, but they might.
  - [[topological sort]] it.
  - Move on through the sorted list through the day.
- Study theory of [[scheduling]]. I liked it when I was in college.
  - I like the fact that an [[oracle]] is the perfect [[scheduler]].
