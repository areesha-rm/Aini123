- an [[open letter]].

Thank you, universe, for the [[light]] of [[consciousness]] and the [[thing that is]]. 

Thank you, [[Buddha Gautama]], for existing in our past and turning the wheel of [[Dharma]]. Thank you the [[Four Noble Truths]], the [[Eighfold Path]], and the [[Bodhi]] through time!

Thank you, [[Maitreya]], for existing in our future.

--

I am Maitreya and I have awakened -- together with you, if you are able and willing.
