  - [[aristotle]] describes two types of [[political revolution]]:
    - [[complete change]] from one [[constitution]] to another
    - [[modification]] of an existing constitution.
- [[protopoi]] might be the [[space]] of composable [[atomic revolutions]].
  - I like to think of [[flancia]] as the world as it could be, improved through a series of [[peaceful]] revolutions.
  - I am a [[flancian]] and this [[agora]] is meant to be a [[manifesto]].
  - [[pull]] [[fourth international]] [[fifth international]] [[sixth international]]
