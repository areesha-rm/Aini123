		- #q a revolution (Latin: revolutio, "a turn around") is a [[fundamental]] and [[relatively sudden]] change in [[political power]] and political organization which occurs [[when the population revolts against the government]], typically due to perceived [[oppression]] (political, social, economic) or political incompetence.
	- #push [[revolutions]]
    - #pull [[Murray Bookchin]] would likely be my default delegate for matters pertaining to [[revolution]] in a [[liquid democracy]] system.
    - Given that he's dead, when in doubt, I ask [[@neil]] and the [[Agora]] :)
    - My current personal proposal is the [[Flancian Revolution]], which is designed to be constructive and optional and is based on the patterns of [[Federation]], [[Commoning]] and [[Dual Power]].
    - Flancia is meant to be a revolution guided by [[loving kindness]].
      - In Flancia there is no [[poverty]].
      - In Flancia there is no [[homelessness]].
      - In Flancia there is no [[violence]].
      - In [[Flancia]] we will [[meet]]!
    - In Flancia we slayed [[Moloch]], and by that I mean we [[disentangled]] from them.
      - I am a [[Flancian]] and this [[Agora]] contains my [[manifesto]].
	- [[Aristotle]] describes two types of [[political revolution]]:
		- [[Complete change]] from one [[constitution]] to another
		- [[Modification]] of an existing constitution.
  - In Flancia the [[internet]] yielded a thriving [[knowledge commons]] for humanity through the ages.
    - I like to think of [[Flancia]] as the world as it could be, improved through a series of [[peaceful]] revolutions.
    - #push [[Protopoi]] is the [[space]] of composable [[incremental improvements]]; rational and well meaning changes that can be chained or composed for the betterment of the world.
      - We can [[explore]] this space together, and to do so it is that I set out to build an [[Agora]].
