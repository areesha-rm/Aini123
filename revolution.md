# Revolution
- a [[process]].
	- #push [[revolutions]]
      - my current proposal is the [[flancian revolution]], which is designed to be reasonably all-optional (see below).
  - Flancia is meant to be a revolution guided by [[loving kindness]].
    - In Flancia we slayed [[Moloch]], and by that I mean we [[disentangled]] from them.
      - In Flancia there is no [[homelessness]].
      - In Flancia there is no [[poverty]].
      - In Flancia there is no [[violence]].
      - In [[Flancia]] we will [[meet]]!

		- [[quote]] a revolution (Latin: revolutio, "a turn around") is a [[fundamental]] and [[relatively sudden]] change in [[political power]] and political organization which occurs [[when the population revolts against the government]], typically due to perceived [[oppression]] (political, social, economic) or political incompetence.
	- [[aristotle]] describes two types of [[political revolution]]:
		- [[complete change]] from one [[constitution]] to another
		- [[modification]] of an existing constitution.

		- I like to think of [[flancia]] as the world as it could be, improved through a series of [[peaceful]] revolutions.
			- [[protopoi]] is the [[space]] of composable [[atomic revolutions]]; rational and well meaning changes for the better.
				- we can [[explore]] this space together, and to do so it is that I set out to build [[an agora]].
				- I am a [[flancian]] and this [[agora]] contains my [[manifesto]].
			- In Flancia they used the [[internet]] to build a global [[commons]].
