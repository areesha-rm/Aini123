# monk

- I've sometimes thought I could be an OK monk. Whether Buddhist or in more of a [[the name of the rose]] scenario, I'm unsure.
- I'd like to meditate more, follow the [[middle way]] more, be awakened more often.

  - during this month I'd like to try to behave a bit more like a monk: meditate more often, be more mindful, try to help others more, be conscious of how I invest my time towards a [[greater goal]].
  - I still have a partner and a high standard of living, so I'm unlike a monk in some ways. I'm more of a "house holder" in Buddhist terms. but I'm not sure the distinction is super relevant in this day and age -- perhaps less so over long periods of practice.
