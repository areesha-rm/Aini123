# Anarchist

- [[go]] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism
  - [[quote]] [[Anarchism]] is a [[political philosophy]] and movement that is [[sceptical of authority]] and rejects all involuntary, [[coercive]] forms of [[hierarchy]]. Anarchism calls for the [[abolition of the state]], which it holds to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful.
- I consider myself a [[socialist]] [[anarchist]], although sometimes I find it hard to reconcile this view with all my [[positions]] or [[views]].
  - I am closer to believing not in an [[abolition of the state]], but on a [[deep reform]] using liquid digital democracy.
