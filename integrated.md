# Integrated

- The [[Agora]] is a set of digital gardens, integrated according to simple rules:
  - If two notes/pages in different gardens refer to the same entity, they are presented sequentially whenever an Agora user visits the node for that entity.
  - That is, if you click on the [[Agora]] [[wikilink]] above, you'll see what *every* Agora user has to say about the Agora.
  - You can think of each node as a single-topic feed, or a sequential [[wiki]].
