# Integrated

- The [[Agora]] is a set of digital gardens, integrated according to simple rules:
  - If two notes/pages in different gardens refer to the same entity, they are presented sequentially whenever an Agora user visits the node for that entity.
  - That is, if you click on [[Agora]] above, you'll see what *every* Agora user has to say about the Agora.
