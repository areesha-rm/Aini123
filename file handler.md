- I just realized I have to implement a proper [[file handler]] for the [[agora]], like what I have for /raw/ URLs but returning a file with the exact name passed (including extension) no matter where it comes from; essentially after flattening the filesystem. 
	- [[pull]] [[agora fs]]
	- [ ] make [[obsidian images]] work in the agora
		- [ ] make [[stoa.png]] work
		- [ ] make [[stoa]] render the inline link
