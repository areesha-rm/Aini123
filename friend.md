# Friend

- I consider my friends to be in the [[agora]].
- I usually tell people online explicitly when I consider them my friends. I then try to mark them as [[friend]] in here, but I haven't done a great job at actually doing that and I haven't yet set up an automated process.
- [[todo]] [[automate]]
