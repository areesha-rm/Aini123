- Back on [[Silverbullet]] after a few days.
  - I moved my journals here also to the root of my garden, as I did with wiki vim a few days back, so you will see them at /YYYY-MM-DD.md from now on instead of at /journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md.
* Today is [[National Day]] in [[Switzerland]] and I don't work. So I plan to do some Agora :)
- I read criticism of the [[Gemini ad]]: https://www.npr.org/2024/07/30/nx-s1-5056201/google-olympics-ai-ad
  - I first read the article and then I watched the ad. 
  - You could say the ad does miss any note worth hitting; I did like some aspects like the dad's voice (is it the real one, I wonder?) and the fact that it's not too long.
  - But it has the usual by now out-of-touch aesthetic of Google ads, which you could call [[enterprise whimsy]]. 
  - And it's just... a bit nonsensical, on top of the other criticisms. Why is the dad involved at all? He comes across as lazy. If this was an ad showing how the little girl can use Gemini to help her with her writing, it would feel a lot more natural/less problematic probably. It *is* true that kids are going to be using generative AI to learn how to write, and the ad could have shown some of that instead.
