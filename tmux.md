- a [[tool]].
	- [[terminal]] [[multiplexer]]
	- I am a [[tmux]] user.
	- I have a love-relationship with it as it makes some things, like copy/paste, harder than I think they could be. then again, I'm not fixing the issues, so :)
	- `ctrl-b` is the default command combination but I more often use `ctrl-a`, after [[screen]], and `ctrl-v` in second-level terminals.
		- I'm thinking of just using `ctrl-b` everywhere as that way I don't need to do configuration in every new host.
	- `ctrl-b w` to list windows.
  - `tmux capture-pane -p -S- > /tmp/output.txt` dumps the full scrollback of the current pane to a temp file. I've tried copying the scrollback fully in other ways... this is the one that worked for me.
