## [[2021-01-25]]

- [[quote]] [[exploration]]: structuring [[collective knowledge]] (developing a case study).
- [[metasj]] kicks off
  - A follow on to an experiment that happened previously on-campus.
  - [[goal]] by the [[end of this week]], we should be able to describe what a satisfying collective experiment could be. Also, we'll have [[cross-pollinated]].
- [[introductions]]
  - [[metasj]]
  - [[agnes cameron]] works with [[metasj]], part of knowledge collaboration innovation data. In [[uk]].
  - [[samir ghosh]] runs a [[maker space]]. Does [[vr]].
  - [[sarah s]] [[neuroscience]] and [[machine learning]]. [[crowdsourcing]] to probe [[human perception]].
  - [[amr kayid]] [[munich]] [[research engineer]] at [[open mind]]. [[reinforcement learning]].
  - [[thomas renkert]] [[religious studies]] [[knowledge representation]].
  - [[kevin]] (pending)
  - [[favour kelvin]]
- [[recap]] of approaches to collective knowledge
  - [[metasj]] how much of the audience's work is about collaborative/collective effort?
    - [[samir ghosh]] used a mega [[google doc]]
    - [[metasj]] how fluid is the membership?
    - [[samir ghosh]] there's a core group of people, but the [[collective]] is nebulous.
    - [[metasj]] there's a tradeoff there.
- [[metasj]] presents slides (see above).
  - [[knowledge futures group]]
    - [[pubpub]]
  - [[goal]]
    - choose a problem that is bigger than what you could solve yourself :)
    - we can take inspiration from [[biology]]; organisms offer lots of patterns that are useful in aggregate
    - [[city construction]]
  - [[classes of models]]
    - you're probably within ~10km of a weather sensor part of a global network, all maintained by [[volunteers]].
    - [[alignment]] vs [[standardization]]
    - [[access]] vs [[catalysis]]
    - [[private service]] vs [[common good]]
      - [[ancestry.com]] vs [[iceland]] (?)
    - [[feedback loops]]
    - [[incentives]] vs [[shared vision]]
  - [[examples]] from [[biology]] and [[earth]] science
    - [[inaturalist]] (!)
    - [[geograph]] (!)
      - had to come up with a local map projection not to change base assumptions they made early on :)
    - [[open street map]]
    - [[ebird]]
      - [[agnes cameron]] is a fan. Comments section is great :)
  - [[examples]] from the group
    - [[flancian]] on the [[agora]]
    - [[thomas renkert]] in some countries, people are assembling lists of people that died due to [[coronavirus]] 
      - [[[nytimes]] did a story on the first 10k people that died.
    - [[sarah s]] on [[imagenet]]
      - [[collective]] in more than one way:
        - corpus based on [[human annotation]]
        - also building off and on several existing efforts, like [[wordnet]]  
      - related problem: updating datasets, contexts.
      - uses of [[latent space]]
    - [[agnes cameron]] on [[arena]]
      - [[push]] [[arena]]
        - <https://www.are.na/agnes-cameron/what-s-are-na>
        - organized in [[channels]]
          - can be [[open]] and [[closed]]
        - [[open source]]
- [[inception]] practice
  - plus challenge for [[wednesday]] 
  - think about [[units of collaboration]] / [[units of work]]
  - who are the [[audiences]]?
- other interesting references
  - [[protocols.io]]
  - [[shader toy]]
  - [[shader park]]
  - [[repl.it]]
  - [[cyberfeminist index]]
  - [[quotebacks]]
  - [[how to make almost anything]]
  - [[free universal construction kit]]
  - [[movebank]]
  - [[wikidata subsetting]]
  - [[corpse2corpse]]
  - [[place subreddit]]

## [[2021-01-27]]

- [[quote]] [[inception]]: knitting the lacework - [[connecting sources]], [[queries, and outputs]]
  - Working with [[public knowledge graphs]], building new [[visualizations]] + [[overlays]]
- [[agnes cameron]] presented an example of [[underlay, interlay, overlay]] reasoning in the field of [[food sustainability]].
- [[blake elias]] [[ai research]] [[covid response]]
  - is [[health]] vs [[economics]] a [[zero sum game]]?
  - [[analysis]]: you can optimize for two things
    - having the fewest covid cases
    - optimize for economics
  - it turns out that in simulation runs the two don't look that different.
    - A Poisson distribution:
    - future cases = random[(current cases) * (reproductive number) + (imported cases)]
  - aside: [[epidemic forecasting]] 
  - aside: [[worry dream]]
  - aside: [[covid tracker]]
  - [[samir ghosh]] (feedback)
  - summary is: 'flattening' at a certain constant level (e.g. 100 cases/day) does *not* work as well as locking down hard and getting to zero (albeit temporarily)
  - [[agnes cameron]] [[imperial college tracker]]
  - [[pandemic game]]
