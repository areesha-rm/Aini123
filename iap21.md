- [[quote]] [[exploration]]: structuring [[collective knowledge]] (developing a case study).
- [[metasj]] kicks off
  - A follow on to an experiment that happened previously on-campus.
  - [[goal]] by the [[end of this week]], we should be able to describe what a satisfying collective experiment could be. Also, we'll have [[cross-pollinated]].
- [[introductions]]
  - [[metasj]]
  - [[agnes cameron]] work with [[metasj]], part of knowledge collaboration innovation data. In [[uk]].
  - [[samir ghosh]] runs a [[maker space]]. Does [[vr]].
  - [[sarah s]] [[neuroscience]] and [[machine learning]]. [[crowdsourcing]] to probe [[human perception]].
  - [[amr kayid]] [[munich]] [[research engineer]] at [[open mind]]. [[reinforcement learning]].
  - [[thomas renkert]] [[religious studies]] [[knowledge representation]].
  - [[kevin]] (pending)
- [[recap]] of approaches to collective knowledge
  - [[metasj]] how much of the audience's work is about collaborative/collective effort?
    - [[samir ghosh]] used a mega [[google doc]]
    - [[metasj]] how fluid is the membership?
    - [[samir ghosh]] there's a core group of people, but the [[collective]] is nebulous.
    - [[metasj]] there's a tradeoff there.
- [[metasj]] presents slides (see above).
  - [[knowledge futures group]]
    - [[pubpub]]
  - [[goal]]
    - choose a problem that is bigger than what you could solve yourself :)
    - we can take inspiration from [[biology]]; organisms offer lots of patterns that are useful in aggregate
    - [[city construction]]
  - [[classes of models]]
    - you're probably within ~10km of a weather sensor part of a global network, all maintained by [[volunteers]].
    - [[alignment]] vs [[standardization]]
    - [[access]] vs [[catalysis]]
    - [[private service]] vs [[common good]]
      - [[ancestry.com]] vs [[iceland]] (?)
    - [[feedback loops]]
    - [[incentives]] vs [[shared vision]]
  - [[examples]] from [[biology]] and [[earth]] science
    - [[inaturalist]] (!)
    - [[geograph]] (!)
      - had to come up with a local map projection not to change base assumptions they made early on :)
    - [[open street map]]
    - [[ebird]]
      - [[agnes cameron]] is a fan. Comments section is great :)
  - [[examples]] from the group
