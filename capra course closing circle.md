	- for [[capra course]]
	- about [[32]] people attending
	- begins with a [[moment of grounding]], 2x [[bell]] (nice) by [[della duncan]]
	- [[fritjof capra]] says:
		- glad to see people face to face, usually enjoy the closing circles tremendously, looking forward to hearing from you
		- taking an opportunity to reflect on the difficult times we're living in, and the transition we're living through.
		- in the last 40 years I have seen technological revolution, backlash -- the turn of the chaotic pendulum
		- [[war in ukraine]] seems to be a regression to the status quo around the 50s-60s
			- grew up tens of miles away from the [[iron curtain]] in [[austria]]
				- the two blocs were in [[competition]]
			- [[bloc thinking]] is making a comeback:
				- [[putin]], who seemingly wants to rebuild the russian empire as it was pre 1989
				- [[nato]], an alliance from [[cold war]] times
				- both blocs are incompatible with the massively interconnected world we live in today
				- our major problems are [[global]] and [[systemic]]
				- we need [[cooperation]], [[negotiation]] and [[compromise]] to solve them, not [[competition]] or [[war]]
				- the outlines of the necessary [[compromise]] in this conflict seem clear:
					- [[putin]] will not get to rebuild imperial russia
					- [[ukraine]] will not get to join [[nato]], but rather remain neutral
			- when dealing with a bully, increasing military tension does not seem a wise path to follow
			- [[cuban missile crisis]] [[1962]] was resolved by [[diplomacy]] and with a compromise
				- [[usa]] withdrew missiles from [[turkey]]
				- [[russia]] withdrew missiles from [[cuba]]
			- hopefully [[diplomacy]] and [[compromise]] will outweigh the [[mechanistic]] bloc thinking from the past
	- [[silvia]] says:

		- [[1k members]] organized in currently [[55 groups]]
		- reach out if you want a [[certificate]]
	- [[della duncan]] on to [[breakout rooms]]
		- "how are you integrating the knowledge from the course"?
		- with [[paul higgings]] and [[dario pulcini]]
			- [[communities of practice]]
			- [[feedback loop]]
				- terminology that is trans-disciplinary has wide appeal
			- let's send links to each other?
				- [[paul]] https://ltcwrk.com/introduction/
		- [[della]]: another alum doing great work with visualizing systems thinking - https://www.lindaboothsweeney.net
	- [[sharing]]
		- [[mandy]]
			- [[illustrator]]
		- [[arnd]]
			- very similar themes in the breakout room
			- how do we engage with each other in a nurturing way? how do we change mindsets?
			- [[feminist morality]]
			- Q: how do we change culture?
				- from the systems point of view, culture is an emergent phenomenon in a network of communications. as communication continues, there are feedback loops, and a system of values and behaviour emerges
				- there is a difference between a [[social system]] and a [[community]]: when the earlier develops a culture, it becomes the latter.
		- [[paul]]
			- how to distill systems thinking for educators?
				- [[fritjof]]: strategy has been to promote the [[capra course]] among educators
				- [[gaia education]] [[work that reconnects]] (sp?) are associated communities
				- [[della duncan]]: [[The Systems Thinking Playbook]]: Exercises to Stretch and Build Learning and Systems Thinking Capabilities"
				- [[silvia]]
			- the impact of network composition: how to combine communities, intensify connections between communities?
		- [[lisa]] how would you describe our community?
			- [[fritjof]] I'd describe it as a [[learning community]]. It seems like the simplest and most powerful way to enact [[transformative learning]], learning which changes our worldview.
				- When we learn in a [[community]], you discuss concept relationships while you experience human relationships; this has a powerful emotional component.
		- [[rito]] the issue of perception and the [[mechanistic mindset]]
			- work/life balance and interconnection
			- [[be like water]]
		- [[thomas]]
			- "think globally, act locally" makes sense -- but now we can "act globally" and that is a beautiful thing
		- [[pankaj]]
			- had a great experience applying systems level thinking
		- [[meriel]]
			- on how to deal with the institutions we interact with (e.g. work with) as we grapple with value alignment
			- â€œThink globally, act accordingly" - [[Terry Tempest Williams]]
		- [[jeanette]]
			- reach out if you're interested in discussing
		- [[ani]]
			- reads out a nice poem, [[a systems point of view]]
