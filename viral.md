  - This is perhaps my "greatest [[virality]]" moment. I guess you could call it the closest I've been to a [[meme]].
  - [[flancia]] is a [[virus]]. You've just been infected; I hope you like it! It tries to be wholly positive; constructive. It never tries to work against you.
  - What is encoded in your most popular [[meme]]?
    - The one at the top, I guess, is mine; my most popular post on social media. I *may* be remembered for it.
    - I'd rather be remembered for a better thing.
    - What is your best [[meme]]? Tell me and I'll listen gladly.
  - I dedicate my live to an [[open nation]].
  - En [[Flancia]] hay un [[Agora]].
