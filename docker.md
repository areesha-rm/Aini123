# Docker
- A [[container]] platform.
	- Someone once told me "X is simpler, better than [[docker]]" but I forgot to write it down :)
	- Perhaps it was [[nomad]]? Need to check if it's at the same level of abstraction.
- [[commands]]
	- [[docker run]] takes an image (might not be local) and runs it, creating a container
	- [[docker start]] starts a previously created container
	- [[docker stop]] stops a running container
	- [[docker ps]] (-a) shows running (all) containers
