# CONTRACT

- I endorse the base [[contract]] of this Agora.
- My contracts are [[lists]] of assertions; they can be taken to include all declarations of [[knowledge]] and [[beliefs]] as expressed in this [[agora]], which is just [[an agora]]; hopefully one of many.
  - These assertions are sometimes organized in [[trees]] and [[graphs]] using the allowances given by this [[agora]] as expressed in [[agora rfcs]].
- I [[intend]] to dedicate a [[meaningful fraction]] of my [[free time]] and [[money]] to improve the world.
  - [[push]] [[manifestos]]
    - I am a [[Flancian]] and this is my [[manifesto]]:
      - In [[Flancia]] there is no [[poverty]].
      - In [[Flancia]] there is no [[unfair privilege]].
      - In [[Flancia]] there will one day [[meet]].
    - In [[Flancia]] we will one day, if you so want it, [[meet]].
- Because I am unskillful, I need your help. I am open to any [[feedback]] anytime.

- This [[agora]] acts as the [[government]] of an [[open nation]].
  - In this nation we uphold all [[human rights]].
  - In this nation there is [[universal basic income]].
