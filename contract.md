# CONTRACT

- I endorse the base [[contract]] of this Agora.
- I [[intend]] to dedicate a [[significant fraction]] of my [[free time]] and [[money]] to improve the world.
- I am A [[Flancian]] and this is my [[manifesto]].
  - In [[Flancia]] there is no [[poverty]].
  - In [[Flancia]] there is no [[privilege]].
  - In [[Flancia]] there is an [[Agora]].
  - In [[Flancia]] we will one day [[meet]].
  - I intend to bring facets of [[Flancia]] into the real world, only as far as they also benefit others, without unilaterally imposing my will.
- Because I am unskillful, I need your help. I am open to any [[feedback]] anytime.
