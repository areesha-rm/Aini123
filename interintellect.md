# Interintellect
- a [[group]]
	- founded by [[Anna Gat]]
	- [[go]] https://interintellect.org
		- hosts a [[mattermost]] instance.
	- centered around [[Salons]] -- relatively exclusive events you usually have to pay a low fee to attend.
	- my old position:

		- I dislike the e
		- [[evaricweicksel]] likes it though, and he seems cool.
		- [[visakanv]] apparently also likes it.
		- I have no idea if I'm in it -- I joined it early, then never heard about it, and [[Anna Gat]] didn't seem interested in interacting with me at all. Yet I received a ping from a random person on Twitter offering a beta program for members of it (?).
