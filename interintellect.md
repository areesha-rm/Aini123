# Interintellect
- a [[group]]
	- founded by [[Anna Gat]]
	- [[go]] https://interintellect.org
		- hosts a [[mattermost]] instance.
	- centered around [[Salons]] -- relatively exclusive events you usually have to pay a low fee to attend.
	- my old position:
		- I dislike the name, a lot. I dislike the whole 'niche', 'intellectual' aspect of it.
		- I dislike the "exclusivity" focus the group seem to have at least in some initial messaging; it felt [[exclusionary]].  I dislike the word "luxe".
		- [[evaricweicksel]] likes it though, and he seems cool.
		- [[visakanv]] apparently also likes it.
		- I don't know if I'm in it -- I joined it early, then never heard about it, and [[Anna Gat]] didn't seem interested in interacting with me at all. Yet I received a ping from a random person on Twitter offering a beta program for members of it (?).
	- My new position:
		- I dislike it when it's exclusive or profit-oriented, I like it when it's inclusive and diverse -- and that's at least most of the time. So it seems irrational to dislike it overall. I'm going to assume it's a group with 90% of people I like.
