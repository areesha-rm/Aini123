# yoga calendar
- #push [[yoga calendars]]
	- [[yoga with adriene]]
	- #go https://yogawithadriene.com/calendar/
		- always links to a calendar for the current month
			- [[fwfg]] sessions might require membership, but there's always a full episode link for each day from the archives -- it works very well IMHO.
	- apart from the "rolling calendars" above, [[adriene mishler]] has done several [[30 days of yoga]] programs. below are the ones I know about.
	- #pull [[30 days of yoga]]
		- the first one. good to get started, IIRC! will do it again soon.
		- the first two episodes are above 30 minutes, which might be challenging for beginners. but there's many shorter than that after that.
	- #pull [[yoga camp]]
	- #pull [[yoga revolution]]
		- never done it, just heard of it, it sounds great obviously though so I'm queueing it
	- #pull [[true]]
		- hmm, I think we might have done this one? need to check.
	- #pull [[dedicate]]
		- never done it so far
	- #pull [[home]]
		- we enjoyed this one. Adriene seemed to be going for more of a serious zen vibe -- but sometimes also seemed tired? in any case, solid.
	- #pull [[move]]
		- the [[state of the art]] in [[yoga calendars]] IMHO
		- we do it by default; we just [[go/move]] and play the episode matching the current calendar day
	- #pull [[foundations of yoga]]
		- not a calendar, but related: a solid playlist
