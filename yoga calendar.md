# yoga calendar
- #push [[yoga calendars]]
	- a [[calendar]]
		- [[yoga with adriene]]
		- [[go]] https://yogawithadriene.com/calendar/
			- publishes a monthly calendar
				- [[fwfg]] sessions might require membership, but there's always a full episode link for each day from the archives -- it works very well IMHO.
			- [[september 2021]]
			- [[october 2021]]
		- #pull [[30 days of yoga]]
			- good to get started, IIRC! will do it again soon.
			- the first two episodes are above 30 minutes, which might be challenging for beginners. but there's many shorter than that after that.
		- #go [[yoga revolution]]
			- never done it
		- #pull [[home]]
			- we enjoyed this one, Adriene seemed to be going for more of a zen vibe -- but sometimes also seemed tired? in any case, solid.
		- #pull [[move]]
			- the [[state of the art]] in [[yoga months]] IMHO
			- we do it by default; we just [[go/move]] and play the episode matching the current calendar day
