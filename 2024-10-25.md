# 2024-10-25
* Back in the Agora!
  * I shipped some small usability improvements this week. I intend to do some more of these during the weekend.
- Work has been fine.
  - It was a relatively productive week; I feel satisfied.
- I thought about [[Magnetism]], as usual. And its [[elasticity]].
  - I want to write something about [[magnets in space]], I think it could go well with that other old idea -- [[monks in space]] :)
