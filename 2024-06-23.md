- I planned to do [[Agora]] work but in the end didn't get to it; maybe I will be able to do a bit of it on Monday after work.
- We managed to do a mini bike-and-run with [[AG]] and it was great :)
- VC'd with my mum :)
- Also VC'd with [[Berni]] as we watched the second half of [[Switzerland-Germany]] together.
- And caught up with [[Kris]].
