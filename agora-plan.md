# Agora Plan

I'll use this as a sort of inline project page for the [[agora]] implementation you're likely reading this in now: [[anagora]].org. This'll be a place to centrally track lightly sorted TODOs, to begin with :)

## Latest
- Moved prod (uwsgi) serving off my user into 'agora'.
- dev environment is now available (when up) at http://dev.anagora.org.
- Moved both dev and prod to separate 'agora' and 'agora-server' repos.

### Signups
 - [[pen-coded]]: https://github.com/KGBicheno/KGB_Agora

## Feature requests
- [[titushora]] [[FR]]: make the [[Agora]] look like this: https://twitter.com/TitusHora/status/1325147589197484036

## Next
- Add user handler: /u
  - /u/flancian -> all nodes by flancian
  - /node/flancia/u/flancian -> flancia by flancian
  - perhaps /g/ for groups later? or /s/ for stoa.
- Add support for media serving (useful for pictures of [[ocell]]).
  - assets/foo end up at node/assets/foo; just adding a handler for node/assets/ seems like it could be enough.
  - It would conflict with a node named 'assets' though, so perhaps it's not ideal.
  - Perhaps it'd be better to just serve images/media as subnodes?
- User profiles: perhaps just note [[flancian]] as written by user [[flancian]]? Unsure.
  - [[s5bug]] suggested using [[README]] in gardens for this. Makes sense.
- Add 'link to this note'.
  - What's the best term for a node-user combination? Is it just 'note'? Entry?
  - subnode.
- Improve backlinks: show snippets as well as just the link.
- Improve pull loop.
- Multi user improvements:
  - Better sorting (right now all my notes show up at the top, doesn't make sense).
  - Ability to "zoom into" a user, to navigate just their garden for a while.
  - Perhaps ability to "uprank" users, pinning their notes to the top of any sorting order.
- Add 'dark mode' to the Agora, I like this kind of scheme: https://twitter.com/ablueaeshna/status/1323439284272222208/photo/1
- Implement search (full text).
- Add config.py file with things such as paths.
- Add monitoring/alerting.
- Make the index be just another note [[ding-levery]].
- Clean up stale journal pages which don't follow [[iso 8601]].

## Some day:
- Support [[Roam]], [[Athens]], [[org-roam]] digital gardens.
- Twitter integration
   - Ask [[ding levery]].
- Automatic [[actions]]
  - [[tweet]] block tweets the block (exactly once, etc.).
- [[go links]] integration
  - If the first block of [[foo]] is a URL, anagora.org/go/foo just redirect there.
  - Could also work as an action: [[go]] target URL.
