# Agora Plan

I'll use this as a sort of inline project page for the Agora; a place to centralize TODOs, to begin with.

## Next:
- Add user handler: /u
  - /u/flancian -> all nodes by flancian
  - /node/flancia/u/flancian -> flancia by flancian
  - perhaps /g/ for groups later? or /s/ for stoa.
- User profiles: perhaps just note [[flancian]] as written by user [[flancian]]? Unsure.
- Add 'dark mode' to the Agora, I like this kind of scheme: https://twitter.com/ablueaeshna/status/1323439284272222208/photo/1
- Implement search (full text).
- Move uwsgi/prod serving off my user into 'agora'.
- Add monitoring/alerting.
- Make the index be just another note [[ding-levery]].
- Clean up stale journal pages which don't follow [[iso 8601]].

## Some day:
- Support Roam, Athens digital gardens
- Twitter integration
- [[actions]]
- [[go links]] integration
