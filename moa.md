# Moa

- a [[siphon]] system
  - a [[siphon]] system is a collection of [[bridges]]
  - so far [[moa]] bridges [[twitter]] and the [[federation]] ([[mastodon]]), 
  - perhaps eventually it will make it so that the particular client or [[gateway]] you use to interact with social networks ceases to matter; your social network becomes platform-agnostic in a sense. 
  - [[moa]] is developed with the vision that what really belongs to users should remain with users. Our personal and social data should always remain with us -- it is our property.
