# Moa

- a [[siphon]] system
  - a [[siphon]] system is a collection of [[bridges]]
  - so far [[moa]] bridges [[twitter]] and the [[federation]] ([[mastodon]]), 
  - perhaps eventually it will make it so that the particular client you use to interact with social networks ceases to matter.
  - or that's the spirit of it anyway, it is a [[project]] to improve it :)
