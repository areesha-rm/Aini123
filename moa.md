# Moa

- a collection of [[bridges]] and [[siphons]]
  - [[go]] https://moa.party
    - [[moa]] bridges [[twitter]] and [[mastodon]] 
    - it will soon also bridge [[instagram]] and the [[agora]]
  - [[git]] https://gitlab.com/fedstoa/moa
  - [[bugs]] https://gitlab.com/fedstoa/moa/-/issues
  - Moa is developed with the vision that what really belongs to users should remain with users. Our personal and social data should always remain with us -- it is our property.
    - Perhaps eventually it will make it so that the particular client or [[gateway]] you use to interact with social networks ceases to matter; your social network becomes platform-agnostic in a sense.
