# simple

- many [[problems]] we need to solve are actually [[simple]]. they might be hard to solve in the sense of being computationally or otherwise resource-intensive. but their inherent structure is not particularly complex.
  - [[coordination problems]] are one such subset.
  - the [[agora]] is a tool to solve [[coordination problems]] while building a [[commons]].
