	- [[distributed vs federated]]
		- a bit stuck here currently
		- the way to conceptualize
		- [[federated]] ~ [[mastodon]]
		- [[distributed]] ~ [[ipfs]] mesh
			- completely open system, if you're in the mesh you're in
			- technologically, user experience wise is great
			- trying to figure out how to deal with the [[cost]] structure
			- in the case of social media, you're making your own twitter
			- how do you get economies of scale worked in there?
				- [[filecoin]]?
				- [[gateway model]]
					- ipfs gateway: there is more than one of them
				- if your mesh contains social data, you get a social network
			- [[ben]] what are the costs involved?
				- [[paul]] unsure but they all seem associated to a side business so far
			- advantages
				- ?
				- serverless clients are possible
			- [[ben]]
				- less well maintained gateways become issues for user experience
				- censorship
				- [[guo]] yes, gateways become a centralized point
					- gateway should be a backup after serverless client
