## [[2021-05-19]]
- [[benedict lau]]
	- [[hypha]]
		- interested in building a tool that publishes through many different protocols
			- sharing social messages seamlessly
		- [[flancian]]
		- [[paul frazee]]
			- [[secure scuttlebut]]
			- [[beaker browser]]
			- [[hypercore protocol]]
				- [[ctzn]]
		- [[guo]]
			- matters.news
			- serving mostly chinese communities
			- looking at [[ipfs]], [[hypercore]]
			- working on a protocol similar to [[unwalled garden]], but also thinking of integrating [[rss]]
				- also interested on [[webmentions]]
		- [[vera]]
			- working on [[agora]]
			- background in distributed social systems, worked on (sp?) status, before mastodon
		- [[fauno]]
			- (mic incoming) :)
- [[paul frazee]] 
	- [[distributed vs federated]]
		- a bit stuck here currently
		- the way to conceptualize
		- [[federated]] ~ [[mastodon]]
		- [[distributed]] ~ [[ipfs]] mesh
			- completely open system, if you're in the mesh you're in
			- technologically, user experience wise is great
			- trying to figure out how to deal with the [[cost]] structure
			- in the case of social media, you're making your own twitter
			- how do you get economies of scale worked in there?
				- [[filecoin]]?
				- [[gateway model]]
					- ipfs gateway: there is more than one of them
				- if your mesh contains social data, you get a social network
			- [[ben]] what are the costs involved?
				- [[paul]] unsure but they all seem associated to a side business so far
			- advantages
				- ?
				- serverless clients are possible
			- [[ben]]
				- less well maintained gateways become issues for user experience
				- censorship
				- [[guo]] yes, gateways become a centralized point
					- gateway should be a backup after serverless client
				- [[paul frazee]]
					- spent 6-8 months working on a social network back in [[beaker]]
					- some stuff that stops you:
						- links that are a new protocol are an issue
						- ux killer on stuff like twitter
					- didn't have a push messaging system back then
						- didn't want to have to deal with spam
						- ux killer: no notifications unless mutual follow
							- [[aggregator]]
					- try to bring in positive properties of the system
				- [[flancian]]
					- [[metcalfe's law]]
				- [[ben]]
					- [[web mentions]]
- [[guo]]
	- content feed + social graph as a distributed publication and social network
	- people can store their content feed and social graph anywhere
	- user control their data
	- search
	- separating storage and aggregation
- [[paul frazee]]
	- database vs datamesh
	- federation puts application logic in the wire protocol
- [[flancian]]
	- [[datamesh]] should probably be treated as a commons
- [[guo]]
	- we could avoid many governance issues at the [[database]] layer
	- [[ben]] this sounds like the [[scuttlebutt]] and [[hypercore model]]?
		- [[paul]] when last involved there was no global entrypoint, it was [[gossip protocol]]
		- [[pubs]] were [[store and forward relays]]
		- information would flow 100% on the basis of the social graph
		- led to complexities; people could give you keys and still be unreachable
- [[flancian]]
	- [[paul]]
		- how do you end up in a situation in which governance is required? 
	- [[guo]]
		- datamesh seems like it does not require governance, but the aggregator does
		- (interlay vs overlay?)
 		- [[ben]] aether (sp?) 
			- distributed reddit
			- distributed moderation
			- liquid democracy-like
		- [[ben]]
			- we need to agree on:
				- schemas
				- distribution protocol
				- aggregator censorship
			- what happens when your computer ends up hosting hate speech?
				- you can stop the flow in the mesh and that applies negative evolutionary pressure
			- [[paul]] aether does [[default allow]], I do [[default deny]]
		- [[flancian]]
			- minimum exchange format
		- [[guo]]
			- choice of markdown vs html
			- chose html over markdown, it supports arbitrary media
			- [[encryption]]
				- exclusive content
				- hard to define protocol-level encryption standard
				- bake the encryption message into the html
					- [[mdx]]
		- [[ben]] decided to first publish/store things as html
			- most people want to have something ready-to-publish
			- but a consumption pattern arises: you copy/paste whole articles
			- on the dweb there is an opportunity for this as we can publish different formats of the same concept
			- get content in more than one format
		- [[paul]]
			- [[schemas]] in general
			- I would describe what you were discussing as "rich text format"
			- orthogonal to schemas
				- fighting with schemas since [[secure scuttlebutt]]
				- pissed off [[rdf]] people
		    	- reached https://ctzn.network/comment
				- scuttlebutt: did not impose *any* schema obligations; disastrous approach
				- [[unwalled gardens]]: enforced types
				- [[ctzn network]]: urls identifying the schemas with a machine readable format
					- rejects messages that don't comply with the schema
					- believe in this approach
						- if you don't, you end up in the tragedy of the commons or failure in collective action (scuttlebutt)
							- compatibility with the schema dictates everything you can do
							- you have a feature, you add a dependency
							- had a post type
								- would be nice if you have a topic
								- if you are not subscribed to [[cats]], you won't see it
								- but you can't rely on it as many clients won't support it
								- you might end up spamming old clients
								- [[fatal ambiguity]]
								- once you see this, schemas start seeming risky to change
								- you can do extension points, but would suggest against
							- current approach:
								- well defined schemas
								- people can determine their own schemas
								- control the [[ctzn network]] schemas
								- can have extension tables
							- [[ben]]
								- feel like [[scuttlebutt]] has a schema, otherwise you couldn't have more than one client
								- what it lacked, it seems, is versioning?
								- how do you manage upgrades?
							 - [[paul]] the problem is multiple clients controlled by different devs
							 - [[flancian]] what do you really need for features -- usually you'd want to have the minimum minimum schema requirements?
							 - [[paul frazee]]
							 	- [[web mentions]]: exploring now
								- [[unwalled garden]]
									- difference between it and [[ctzn network]]
								- suppose you want to have the ability to have mentions in your comments
									- you have to keep parsing for entities if you store text or text-like
									- using [[hyperbee]] in [[ctzn]]
										- it can list directories or keyspaces in order
									    - more like a database technology
								- for distributed press/unwalled garden: file oriented approach can work over http
						- [[guo]] in the comments problem, who owns the post data?
							- the post it's on could 'own' it
							- the [[comment]] writer could own it
								- this seems safer?
						- [[fauno]]
							- if we allow for comments, who is responsible for keeping them? hateful comments/censorship/etc
							- [[webmentions]]: fascist websites pinging you
							- people don't have time to moderate
						- [[ben]] same thing is seen in wordpress
						- [[fauno]] web mentions and how to keep bad parties out
						- [[flancian]] how will moderation work in [[ctzn network]]? 
							- [[paul]] would like to have a great answer :)
								- [[reputation systems]]
									- no one size fits all
									- this lets you scale the work
									- reputational graph approach
								- [[subjective moderation]]
