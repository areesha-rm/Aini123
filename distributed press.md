## [[2021-05-19]]
- [[benedict lau]]
	- [[hypha]]
		- interested in building a tool that publishes through many different protocols
			- sharing social messages seamlessly
		- [[flancian]]
		- [[paul frazee]]
			- [[secure scuttlebut]]
			- [[beaker browser]]
			- [[hypercore protocol]]
				- [[ctzn]]
		- [[guo]]
			- matters.news
			- serving mostly chinese communities
			- looking at [[ipfs]], [[hypercore]]
			- working on a protocol similar to [[unwalled garden]], but also thinking of integrating [[rss]]
				- also interested on [[webmentions]]
		- [[vera]]
			- working on [[agora]]
			- background in distributed social systems, worked on (sp?) status, before mastodon
		- [[fauno]]
			- (mic incoming) :)
- [[paul frazee]] 
	- [[distributed vs federated]]
		- a bit stuck here currently
		- the way to conceptualize
		- [[federated]] ~ [[mastodon]]
		- [[distributed]] ~ [[ipfs]] mesh
			- completely open system, if you're in the mesh you're in
			- technologically, user experience wise is great
			- trying to figure out how to deal with the [[cost]] structure
			- in the case of social media, you're making your own twitter
			- how do you get economies of scale worked in there?
				- [[filecoin]]?
				- [[gateway model]]
					- ipfs gateway: there is more than one of them
				- if your mesh contains social data, you get a social network
			- [[ben]] what are the costs involved?
				- [[paul]] unsure but they all seem associated to a side business so far
			- advantages
				- ?
				- serverless clients are possible
			- [[ben]]
				- less well maintained gateways become issues for user experience
				- censorship
				- [[guo]] yes, gateways become a centralized point
					- gateway should be a backup after serverless client
				- [[paul frazee]]
					- spent 6-8 months working on a social network back in [[beaker]]
					- some stuff that stops you:
						- links that are a new protocol are an issue
						- ux killer on stuff like twitter
					- didn't have a push messaging system back then
						- didn't want to have to deal with spam
						- ux killer: no notifications unless mutual follow
							- [[aggregator]]
					- try to bring in positive properties of the system
				- [[flancian]]
					- [[metcalfe's law]]
				- [[ben]]
					- [[web mentions]]
- [[guo]]
	- content feed + social graph as a distributed publication and social network
	- people can store their content feed and social graph anywhere
	- user control their data
	- search
	- separating storage and aggregation
- [[paul frazee]]
	- database vs datamesh
	- federation puts application logic in the wire protocol
- [[flancian]]
	- [[datamesh]] should probably be treated as a commons
- [[guo]]
	- we could avoid many governance issues at the [[database]] layer
	- [[ben]] this sounds like the [[scuttlebutt]] and [[hypercore model]]?
		- [[paul]] when last involved there was no global entrypoint, it was [[gossip protocol]]
		- [[pubs]] were [[store and forward relays]]
		- information would flow 100% on the basis of the social graph
		- led to complexities; people could give you keys and still be unreachable
- [[flancian]]
	- [[paul]]
		- how do you end up in a situation in which governance is required? 
	- [[guo]]
		- datamesh seems like it does not require governance, but the aggregator does
		- (interlay vs overlay?)
 		- [[ben]] aether (sp?) 
			- distributed reddit
			- distributed moderation
			- liquid democracy-like
		- [[ben]]
			- we need to agree on:
				- schemas
				- distribution protocol
				- aggregator censorship
			- what happens when your computer ends up hosting hate speech?
				- you can stop the flow in the mesh and that applies negative evolutionary pressure
			- [[paul]] aether does [[default allow]], I do [[default deny]]
		- [[flancian]]
			- minimum exchange format
		- [[guo]]
			- choice of markdown vs html
			- chose html over markdown, it supports arbitrary media
			- [[encryption]]
				- exclusive content
				- hard to define protocol-level encryption standard
				- bake the encryption message into the html
					- [[mdx]]
		- [[ben]]
