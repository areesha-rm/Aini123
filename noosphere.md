- "The noosphere is a philosophical concept developed and popularized by the biogeochemist Vladimir Vernadsky, and the French philosopher and Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. Vernadsky defined the noosphere as the new state of the biosphere[1] and described as the planetary "sphere of reason".[2][3] The noosphere represents the highest stage of biospheric development, its defining factor being the development of humankind's rational activities.[4]"
