# Do

- A [[verb]].
  - An [[action]] in the [[agora]].
  - The root of my [[getting things done]] graph.
- [[Every day]], I try to read:
  - [[daily]].
- [[Every day]], I try to check for pending [[work]]:
  - Here.
  - in [[todo]] (deprecated)
  - [[pull]] in [[next action]]
- [[sometimes]], check other common actions and push some part of them to [[do]] or [[next action]]:
  - [[read]]
  - [[write]]
  - [[answer]]
  - [[link]]
  - [[search]]
  - [[research]]
  - [[send]]
  - [[implement]]
  - [[code]] 
  - [[buy]]
- Using all of this I'm trying to execute a [[plan]]. An [[algorithm]].
  - (I self-apply a computational model of the mind to my [[self]], let me know if this is ever distracting.)
