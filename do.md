# Do

- A [[verb]].
  - An [[action]] in the [[agora]].
  - The root of my [[getting things done]] graph.
- [[next action]]: pick task from https://twitter.com/flancian/status/1372986224495968266
- [[every day]], I try to check for pending [[work]]:
  - here
    - clean up old pushes
  - in [[daily]]
  - in [[todo]] (deprecated)
    - clean up items, move elsewhere
  - in [[next action]]
- [[weekly]], check other common actions and push some part of them to [[do]] or [[next action]]:
  - [[read]]
  - [[write]]
  - [[answer]]
  - [[link]]
  - [[search]]
  - [[research]]
  - [[send]]
  - [[implement]]
  - [[code]] 
  - [[buy]]
- On top of this idiosyncratic system I'm trying to execute a [[plan]].
