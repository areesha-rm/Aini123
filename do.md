- a [[list]].
	- [[irregular]].
		- could be [[todos]]
  - actions for which I want to express an [[intent]].
		- [[pull]] [[ought]]
		- [[pull]] [[intent]] [[later]] [[todo]] [[now]] [[next]] [[some day]] 
		- [[pull]] [[flancia]] [[agora]]
		- [[meditate]] now.
	- do [[pomodoros]]
	- configure [[probing]]
		- I never get to this, can you tell it reminds me of work? :)
		- I need to just set a pomodoro and do this, but I feel like running the agora at low slo is OK. It's supposed to rely on distribution later on for reliability gains.
		- Doesn't really apply as an argument to [[moa]] though -- although for [[moa]] we have [[sentry]] set up so that seems reasonable.
			- [ ] set up [[probing]] for [[moa]]
			- [ ] set up [[probing]] for [[anagora]]
	- [[push]] [[moa]]
		- [ ] review [[go/moa/bugs]]
	- [[push]] [[agora]]
		- [ ] add toggle switch for [[auto pull]] (stoa, linked nodes, backlinks?)
			- [x] doing this for [[stoa]] stops it from stealing focus which is really irksome :) fixing it in etherpad would take me long as I'm bad at js
				- done! just replaced the stoa with a pull button always for now.
		- [ ] implement [[auto pull]]
		- [ ] implement [[auto push]]
		- [ ] client side pulling
			- done for: mastodon, twitter
			- need to add [[wikipedia]]
		- [[agora bot]]
			- [ ] fix twitter so it doesn't keep re-replying
  			- the API doesn't feel great, I wonder if I'm missing something
			- [ ] refactor mastodon<->twitter so they share code? I don't want to implement everything twice, and I certainly don't want the mastodon version to suffer because I'm addicted to twitter (great people there as well, and there are more of them)
		- improve [[agora graphs]]
			- I like what logseq does: show link direction as particles. push/pull could be different particles. hmm. particle diagrams. check out [[feynman]] for inspiration?
			- could get inspiration from some diagrams in [[a rosetta stone]]
		- [[wikilinks everywhere]] -> [[agora ext]]
			- I really want to move wikilinking to on-demand (push button/ctrl-shift-l) or cronjob-like behaviour but right now it just wikilinks everything every time you click, and some sites break
				- this is already better after a quick PR to linkify on *click* instead of mouse movement
				- twitter still sort of breaks though
				- [[vera]] is on this though
	- [[push]] [[agora interlace]]
		- [[agora social media integration]]
			- [x] write [[agora bot]] for [[mastodon]]
			- [ ] write [[agora bot]] for [[twitter]]
				- [ ] fix auth
					- [ ] restore context
						- [[next action]]
				- [ ] fix deduping 
			- [ ] test [[vera]]'s code for pulling tweets and toots
				- [ ] only pulled *some* for some reason
				- [ ] figure out what's up, try again and get the context back
		- depends on [[agora bridge api]] for the storing posts in the agora.
			- we want to create a git repository for each calling users, which the users could then [[claim]].
			- could be flask, included in [[agora bridge]] repo, copy/paste from [[agora server]] to begin with?
			- one risk is them actually needing to share more than I expect
			- but hopefully they can just communicate through yaml? or perhaps set up and write to sqlite to begin with
			- thought of consolidating everything into [[agora server]], but it feels cleaner to have writers and readers split. should scale better; if the write path goes down, the agora keeps serving just fine without having to do anything special.
  			- probably keeps it simple to run a read only agora (mirror).
	- [[agora bridge api]]
		- I'll probably add a [[flask]] based api to [[agora bridge]] to:
			- request new git integrations (e.g. mount git repo X in path Y)
			- accept other inputs? like perhaps subnodes, which could go into a managed repo.
			- configure sources from social media (from agora bot)
	- [[write]]
    - [[patterns]]
		- [[after the pandemic]], or [[an open letter to the agora]]
		- [[on cringe]] / [[agora polls]]
			- about explicit rational (mathematical) modelling of group dynamics through social media discourse
			- is [[hack the planet]] cringe? should it be?
			- why is it cringe to talk about virtue?
	- [[read]] 
		- what [[will walker]] told me about
			- link it here
	- run [[weekly review]]
		- I'm doing it now... still :) it turns out I come to this node weekly at best, so this *is* my weekly. I'd love to make it daily though. perhaps I could auto-pull [[do]] from the journal page? just the subnode for the 'active' user.
- an [[agora action]]
	- I try to automate recurrent [[actions]] in the [[agora]].
	- This node is the root of my [[getting things done]] graph, which I try to use to model my [[intents]].
	- [[daily]], I try to check for pending [[work]] in all known sources of truth.
	- check the context in more specific actions and push relevant items here or to [[next action]]:
	- what should I [[read]] next
	- [[write]]
		- [[flancia]]
			- [[book]]
			- [[an open letter for an open society]]
		- to [[a. p.]] asking for a recommendation
	- [[unblock]] people who are waiting for me
- [[research]]
	- [[ipfs]]
	- [[ipld]]
	- [[fission]]
	- [[hypercore-proto]]
	- [[launchlet]]
	- [[urbit]]
		- [[rosano]]
	- [[support]]
		- [[effective altruism]]
		- [[flancia collective]]
		- [[open source]]
		- [[friends]]
		- [[public utility]]
	- [[code]]
		- [[agora server]]
			- add particles to [[agora search]]
				- particles again.
		- [[wikilinks everywhere]] / [[agora ext]]
			- could [[d3]] replace [[jquery]]? it would make it easy to also include a graph tool directly in the library. it's 200kb though.
				- ask [[vera]]
		- a more flexible [[actions]] system
- a place for [[feedback]]
	- Please tell me what you think I should do next below or via any of the channels listed in [[flancian]]. All feedback is welcome!
- [[push]] [[done]]
	- implement [[ack]]
	- [[agora yaml]]
	- [[agora plan]]
	- [[rdf]]
		- [[graphs]]
	- [[agora search]]
		- implemented a provider
		- added support for [[yubnub]] like particles
		- [[branch]] agora-server/branch
		- [[push]] [[done]]
	- implemented support for [[obsidian attachments]] in [[agora server]]
		- basic but it does the job (tm)
