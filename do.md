- my current [[intent]] is: catch up with inbox and do a run over [[do]] (cleanup/prioritization/integration)
- [[push]] [[done]]
	- implemented support for [[obsidian attachments]] in [[agora server]]
		- basic but it does the job (tm)
- configure [[probing]] for [[moa]]
- configure [[probing]] for [[anagora]]
- review [[go/moa/bugs]]
- [[agora]]
- implement [[auto push]]
- add toggle switch for [[auto pull]] (stoa, linked nodes, backlinks?)
	- doing this for [[stoa]] stops it from stealing focus which is really irksome :) fixing it in etherpad would take me long as I'm bad at js
	- improve [[agora graphs]]
		- what does this *mean*?
		- I like what logseq does: show link direction 
	- [[wikilinks everywhere]]
	- aka [[agora ext]]
		- [[vera]] is on this
	- write [[on cringe]] / [[agora polls]]
		- about explicit rational (mathematical) modelling of group dynamics through social media discourse
		- is [[hack the planet]] cringe? should it be?
	- node [[paradox of tolerance]]
	- finish reading what [[will walker]] told me about
	- run [[weekly review]]
	- [[pull]] [[later]]
	- I'm trying to use [[pomodoro]]. It signals an [[intent]]. My intent is [[getting things done]].
		- Whenever I notice the risk of getting distracted from the task at hand, I dump thoughts in [[later]].
		- My current running contexts or intents follow (they expand into lists of todo items/trees/graphs depending on level of modelling).
		- (I also keep a [[notebook]])
- an [[action]]
	- I try to automate recurrent [[actions]] in the [[agora]].
	- This node is the root of my [[getting things done]] graph, which I try to use to model my [[intents]].
	- [[daily]], I try to check for pending [[work]]:
		- [[pull]] [[todo]]
			- [ ] clean up items there and pushes, moving closer to a [[context]].
	- [[weekly]], check the context in more specific actions and push relevant items here or to [[next action]]:
		- what should I [[read]] next?
		- [[write]]
			- [[book]]
			- to [[a. p.]] asking for a recommendation
		- [[unblock]] people who are waiting for me
			- [[answer]]
				- [[will walker]]
		- [[research]]
			- [[ipfs]]
			- [[ipld]]
			- [[fission]]
			- [[hypercore-proto]]
			- [[launchlet]]
			- [[urbit]]
			- [[rosano]]
		- [[support]]
			- [[effective altruism]]
			- [[open source]]
			- [[friends]]
		- [[code]]
			- [[agora server]]
				- add particles to [[agora search]]
			- [[wikilinks everywhere]]
				- would it be crazy to use [[d3]] instead of [[jquery]]? it would make it easy to also include a graph tool directly in the library. it's 200kb though.
			- a more flexible [[actions]] system
	- On top of this idiosyncratic system I'm trying to execute a [[plan]]. If you're interested please also review [[priorities]], [[public utility]]
	- Please tell me what you think I should do next below. All feedback is welcome!
- [[push]] [[done]]
	- [[agora yaml]]
	- [[agora plan]]
	- [[rdf]]
		- [[graphs]]
	- [[agora search]]
		- implemented a provider
		- added support for [[yubnub]] like particles
		- [[branch]] agora-server/branch
