# Do

- An [[action]].
- A [[verb]].
- [[Every day]], read:
  - [[daily]].
- [[Every day]], check links:
  - [[do]]
  - [[todo]].
  - [[next action]]
  - (also search for '\[ \]' while todo tracking is not implemented)
- [[Every week]], check links to other common actions:
  - [[read]]
  - [[write]]
  - [[answer]]
  - [[link]]
  - [[search]]
  - [[research]]
  - [[send]]
  - [[implement]]
  - [[code]] 
  - [[buy]]
- Using all of this I'm trying to build a [[plan]].
