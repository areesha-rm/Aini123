# Do

- I'm trying to use [[pomodoro]] more. It signals an [[intent]].
  - Whenever I notice the risk of getting distracted from the task at hand, I dump thoughts in [[later]].
  - My current running contexts or intent (they expand into a graph):
    - [[agora search]]
      - implementing a provider 
      - support [[yubnub]] like particles
      - [[branch]] agora-server/branch
    - write [[on cringe]] / [[agora polls]]
      - about explicit rational (mathematical) modelling of group dynamics through social media discourse
      - is [[hack the planet]] cringe? should it be?
    - node [[paradox of tolerance]]
    - [[wikilinks everywhere]]
- An [[action]] in the [[agora]].
  - The root of my [[getting things done]] graph.
  - [[next action]] 
    - [[answer email]] 
    - [[agora yaml]]
  - [[daily]], try to check for pending [[work]]:
    - in [[todo]]
      - clean up items there and pushes, try move closer to a [[context]].
  - [[weekly]], check the context in more specific actions and push relevant items here or to [[next action]]:
    - [[read]]
    - [[write]]
      - to [[a. p.]] asking for a recommendation
    - [[answer]]
      - [[will walker]]
    - [[link]]
    - [[search]]
    - [[research]]
      - [[ipfs]]
      - [[ipld]]
      - [[fission]]
      - [[hypercore-proto]]
      - [[launchlet]]
      - [[urbit]]
    - [[send]]
      - [[money]] to [[effective altruism]]
    - [[implement]]
    - [[code]] 
      - [[agora server]]
        - add particles to [[agora search]]
      - [[wikilinks everywhere]]
        - clone mvp
        - would it be crazy to use [[d3]] instead of [[jquery]]? it would make it easy to also include a graph tool directly in the library. it's 200kb though.
  - On top of this idiosyncratic system I'm trying to execute a [[plan]].
    - [[priorities]]
  - Please tell me what you think I should do next below. All feedback is welcome!
