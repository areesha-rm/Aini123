- [[pomodoro]]
  - I'm trying to use [[pomodoro]]. It signals an [[intent]]. My intent is [[getting things done]].
    - Whenever I notice the risk of getting distracted from the task at hand, I dump thoughts in [[later]].
    - My current running contexts or intents follow (they expand into lists of todo items/trees/graphs depending on level of modelling).
    - (I also keep a [[notebook]])
  - configure [[monitoring]]. 
    - [[estimate]]:
      - [ ] one pomodoro for moa
      - [ ] one pomodoro for anagora
  - do [[moa]]
    - integrate vera's code
      - [ ] find it
    - review [[go/moa/bugs]]
  - [[ctzn]] 
    - [[agora ctzn]]
  - [[agora]]
    - [[auto push]]
    - [[auto pull]]
    - stop [[stoa]] from stealing focus
    - fix [[agora graphs]]
      - different colors for pull/push/link/backlink
  - [[wikilinks everywhere]]
    - [[vera]] is on this
    - move her code to [[agora ext]]?
    - add logo for store page
    - test on [[chrome]]
  - [[read]]
  - write [[on cringe]] / [[agora polls]]
    - about explicit rational (mathematical) modelling of group dynamics through social media discourse
    - is [[hack the planet]] cringe? should it be?
  - node [[paradox of tolerance]]
  - finish reading what [[will walker]] told me about
  - run [[weekly review]]
  - [[pull]] [[later]]
- An [[action]] in the [[agora]].
  - This is the root of my [[getting things done]] graph, which I try to use to model my [[intents]].
  - [[daily]], I try to check for pending [[work]]:
    - in [[todo]]
      - clean up items there and pushes, try move closer to a [[context]].
  - [[weekly]], check the context in more specific actions and push relevant items here or to [[next action]]:
    - [[read]]
    - [[write]]
      - to [[a. p.]] asking for a recommendation
    - [[answer]]
      - [[will walker]]
    - [[link]]
    - [[search]]
    - [[research]]
      - [[ipfs]]
      - [[ipld]]
      - [[fission]]
      - [[hypercore-proto]]
      - [[launchlet]]
      - [[urbit]]
    - [[send]]
      - [[money]] to [[effective altruism]]
    - [[implement]]
    - [[code]] 
      - [[agora server]]
        - add particles to [[agora search]]
      - [[wikilinks everywhere]]
        - clone mvp
        - would it be crazy to use [[d3]] instead of [[jquery]]? it would make it easy to also include a graph tool directly in the library. it's 200kb though.
  - On top of this idiosyncratic system I'm trying to execute a [[plan]]. If you're interested please also review [[priorities]], [[public utility]]
  - Please tell me what you think I should do next below. All feedback is welcome!
- [[push]] [[done]]
  - [[agora yaml]]
  - [[agora plan]]
  - [[rdf]]
    - [[graphs]]
  - [[agora search]]
    - implemented a provider 
    - added support for [[yubnub]] like particles
    - [[branch]] agora-server/branch
