- I read his [[Greek Myths]] and [[I, Claudius]] when I was a kid.
- I read [[Seven Years in New Crete]] a few years back.
- I visited his house on [[2024-09-18]] as we passed through [[Dei√†]] with [[AG]] :)
  - It made me remember [[Robert Graves]] and my love for him.
  - Which led me to think of reading more of his.
  - I hope to be back soon with more time :)
