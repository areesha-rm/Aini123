  - An [[integration hub]] that hosts [[bots]], [[clients]] and [[siphons]]; any [[bridges]] of [[public utility]].

  - Bridges are configured with [[yaml]].
    - [[yaml]] can be volunteered as the [[digital garden]] of a user participating in a community, or in the form of a [[bridges yaml]] file that is associated with an [[agora]].
    - Signup to an [[agora]] then involves pointing [[agora bridge]] to your configuration file as published somewhere on the internet and asking it 
      - [[agora yaml]]
