# Sequential Wiki

- Not a formal term, but I use it often. A sequential wiki is like a wiki page, but people contribute *blocks* of [[content]] instead of arbitrary fragments; and they maintain clear ownership and control over their blocks.
- I call the [[agora]] a distributed sequential wiki. [[nodes]] are akin to sequential wiki pages. [[subnodes]] are user contributed blocks. 
- [[pull]] [[everything2]]
