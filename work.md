# Work
- #pull [[job]]
- an [[action]].
	- [[What we do for a living]].
		- I am an [[sre]] at [[Google]].
	- I've worked [[full time]] for the last 10 years or so. As of [[2021-01-10]] I'm moving to [[80% time]] as an experiment.
		- I'm taking [[wednesdays]] off.
		- Update, [[2022]]: I take about half wednesdays off, usually I find it hard to keep up with work otherwise, using always just [[vacation time]] or [[occ time]]. I don't take many long holidays so all in all it  still a noticeably improvement over [[full time]].
