- Part of [[open letters]].
  - #pull [[carta abierta a milei]]

--

I was unsure about whether to write this letter in my native Spanish, which would make the most sense when addressing directly [[Javier Milei]] as we share that piece of background, or in English, which would probably guarantee the widest understanding and distribution. In the end I've decided to try doing both, in true 'try things and see what sticks' tradition.
