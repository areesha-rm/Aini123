Many [[open letters]] in this [[Agora]] are fragmentary in nature, being assembled from fragments contributed by different people. So I feel it's perfectly normal to write different instances of the same letter even as one person. Maybe they are different threads; maybe they are different snapshots in time of one's feeling and conditions.

In any case, here's my second letter to [[Elon Musk]]. Enjoy!
