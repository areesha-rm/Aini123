# Auto Commit Messages

- [[jonathan]] and [[luciana]] both complained about having to write commit messages in [[foam]] when using the [[agora]].
- The solution is:
  - Create a text file in your garden; I call mine ```commit.txt```.
  - Write in it whatever you would like all your commit messages to default to; you can just press enter and get whatever you have in this file.
  - Run this in that directory: ```git config --local commit.template commit.txt```
    - In VSCode, you can press ctrl-shift-c and get a terminal in which you should be able to paste that command. Presumably :) Let me know if this doesn't work for you!
  - Optional: bind a key combination to "commit all". I use ctrl-alt-a.
    - Press ctrl-k ctrl-s (this means to hold control and press k and s in succession).
    - Type 'commit all' to find the matching command.
    - Double click on it, press ctrl-alt-a, enter.
    - Now you can press ctrl-alt-a and all files will be saved and then submitted to your git repo, and from there to the Agora.
    - A is for Agora :)
