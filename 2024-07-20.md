- So it turns out that for years I have been sometimes journaling in `/YYYY-MM-DD.md` and sometimes in `journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, depending on how I created the entry.
  - If I press e.g. ctrl-w ctrl-w in [[vim]], I go to the daily page as configured by [[wiki vim]] -- which is the later.
  - If I link [[YYYY-MM-DD]] in the past, I usually will have a journal already, and wiki vim will redirect there.
  - If I link [[YYYY-MM-DD]] in the future, though, I will not have a journal yet, so the file will be created as a "common node", outside of journals.
  - I thought I had moved to a 'flat space' with everything including journals in the [[root of my garden]], but apparently that didn't happen yet :)
