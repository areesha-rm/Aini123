# Pulled Nodes

- Nodes that are specially relevant to the context at hand can be pulled. To do this, just add a block using the pull action:
  - [[pull]] [[pull]]
- Currently pulls like the above only work when you are in precisely the context they are declared; that is, pulling is not recursive. This might change.
