# Pulled Nodes

- [[pull]] [[pulled links]]
- Currently pulls like the above only work when you are in precisely the context they are declared; that is, pulling is not recursive. This might change.

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[pull]: pull "Pull"
[pulled links]: pulled-links "Pulled Links"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
