# Problem of Universals

- [[go]]  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_universals
  - [[quote]] Should the properties an object has in common with other objects, such as color and shape, be considered to exist beyond those objects?
  - [[quote]] Philosophers agree that human beings can talk and think about universals, but disagree on whether universals exist in reality beyond mere thought and speech.
  - Seems potentially related to [[qualia]] and the [[hard problem of consciousness]].
