# Auto Wikilinking

- [[push]] [[deliverables]].
- a call for a [[design]]: the [[agora]] should have auto-wikilinking. 
- imagine a slider so the user can specify the level of connectivity they want to see in subnodes.
- this means automatically linking wherever there could be useful links that the writer didn't specify
and also of course removing spurious or lower quality links using some interesting measure of relevance.
