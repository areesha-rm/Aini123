# Orgpython

- [[go]] https://pypi.org/project/org-python/
  - I'm using this library to support [[org mode]] in the [[agora]] for now -- but it seems a bit limited.

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[go]: go "Go"
[org mode]: org-mode "Org Mode"
[agora]: agora "Agora"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
