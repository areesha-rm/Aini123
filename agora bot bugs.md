	- fix responses to messages with more than one wikilink. this is a typical [[greedy regex]] mistake :) this bug is of course not in the agora
	- make it respond by starting a new thread so it doesn't take up too much space
	- make it work with wikilinks that have already been resolved, like [[vera]]'s
