- a [[book]].
  - Or booklet?
  - I got in [[Dhagpo Männedorf]].
  - It is in what looks like [[Devanagari]] and [[German]], so I'll take it as an opportunity to learn at least the latter :)

1. Das Gebet an die Meister der Mahamudra Linie

The X (to?) the master of the Mahamudra line

Maybe Gebet is offering? Checking. Ah no, it's [[prayer]]. Well, I don't normally think I pray, but I do recitate mantras to Tara, Avalokiteshvara and [[Maitreya]], so I guess it's a matter of interpretation.

Wow, this got real. The next two pages have 6-7 sentences each, and three illustrations overall.

2. Allgegenwärtiger, grosser Dordje Tschang, denken an uns,
  Tilopa "Reine Weisheit", denke an uns,
  Naropa "Verwirklichung von Gewahrsein", denke an uns,
  Marpa "Verstandnis der Lehre" (...)

There's eight more pages of this (!). It turns out this is the part that is all about the lineage of teaching. I was surprised at first that it didn't start with the Buddha, but then I realized this is the preliminaries.
