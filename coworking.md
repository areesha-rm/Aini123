# coworking

- I sometimes think of myself as a hermit, but in practice I like the company of people. Often I need some downtime, though, which means essentially to read a book or use a computer. I enjoy doing this while other people do the same or something equivalent.
- Perhaps [[cobeing]] could be a better term.
