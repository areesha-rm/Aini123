# Agora Version

- You are currently reading this on an [[agora]] deemed experimental.
  - Previously we were using [[semantic versioning]] and got up to 0.5.5 or something, but it felt a bit arbitrary.
  - See [[go/agora-server]] for full versioning information.
  - `0.anagora.org` currently serves `anagora.org` and mostly runs from HEAD.
  - `1.anagora.org` is architecture-decoupled and runs an old (stable?) version, just in case.
  - See [[agora plan]], [[agora feature requests]], [[go/agora/bugs]], [[agora protocol]], [[do]] for what's likely in store :)
